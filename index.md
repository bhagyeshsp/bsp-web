        <p>Hi, let's make this easy.</p>
        <p>My name is Bhagyesh Pathak.</p>
        <p>If we were strangers riding an elevator and you asked me what I do, I'd answer "I provide tech and design solutions to businesses through my firm named <a href="https://sisyphusconsulting.org?ref=bhagyeshpathak.com">Sisyphus Consulting</a>. We focus only a select few things and do them right."</p>
        <p>Then I'll ask you a question, you'll answer the question. Back-and-forth, back-and-forth.
        And what if we hit it off?</p>
        <p>Then eventually you'd learn the things I have listed on my <a href="{{'/about/' | relative_url }}">About Page</a>. I need to update it, but still take a look.</p>

## What I'm doing nowadays?

See my [Now Page]({{'/now' | relative_url}}) to find out what I'm upto.

## What do I write about?

I mostly write about tech, design, marketing, behaviour change, organization development, change management etc. You can find those ideas in my [Blog Page]({{'/blog' | relative_url}}). I also publish a not-so regular newsletter called [Sisyphus Notes]({{'/newsletter' | relative_url}}). Oh and before that, I used to publish The Friday Newsletter. You can find its full archive [here]({{'/newsletter#tfn-archive' | relative_url}}).

## My bookshelf

Being an avid reader, I have collected a number of books over the years. And read many of them. I have listed some of my favourite ones on my virtual bookshelf under my [Reading List Page]({{'/reading-list' | relative_url}}). You may not be able to pay a visit to my physical bookshelf, but this is the closest you can get.

## Listener instead?

I know a few people who'll devour a 2-hour podcast in a single sitting, but they'll never flip a page of a book. If you are one of them, you can check out my [Listening List Page]({{'/listening-list' | relative_url}}). I only listen to a handful of podcasts or audio tracks, not a big fan of the format, but who doesn't like the variety once in a while?

## Work with me(?)

I think when people write "work with me" on their website, there are two possible connotations:

1. A polite, non-needy way of saying "hire me"
2. An invitation to join ongoing work at their firm

This _work with me_ carries both meanings: you can hire my consultancy to provide you with services and if you're looking for work, you can check with me.
Whichever the case, you can navigate to [Sisyphus Consulting](https://sisyphusconsulting.org?ref=bhagyeshpathak.com) and click the appropriate button.

## Contact me

If you just want to say "hi", <a onclick="copyEmail()" class="copy-btn"> click here <span class="tooltip">Click to copy email</span> </a> and my email will get copied. I reply to all emails. Almost immediately. I'm one of those people who likes to send and receive emails for fun.

And what about work emails? Uggh, emails for work? No thanks, [I use Basecamp](https://sisyphusconsulting.org/how-we-work?ref=bhagyeshpathak.com).
