        <p><em>This about page is slightly dated. So, enjoy it until I update it. Meanwhile, you can learn <a href="/now">what I’m doing right now</a>.</em></p>

<p>10 years ago, I received an offer I couldn’t refuse.</p>

<p>How could have I turned down the chance to embark on an incredible journey? It was aboard a state-of-the-art train, covering 17,000 km, and traversing every Indian state non-stop for 7 months. This experience not only introduced me to the world of work but also transformed my outlook on life. It was vibrant, challenging, and youthful, in short — enchanting.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, I’ve primarily collaborated with founders of various organizations, predominantly small to medium-sized ones, helping bring their visions to life.</p>

<p>As my capacity allows me to take on only a limited number of assignments each year, I’m excited about the prospect of working with an exceptional group of individuals in the next decade.</p>

<p>Frequently, people ask me about the types of assignments I can assist with. While I can certainly provide a list of my past projects, there’s no guarantee that my next assignment will mirror my previous ones.</p>

<p>For instance, I’ve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implemented systems for data collection, analysis, and monitoring for a dynamic organization.</li>
  <li>Set up a marketing funnel and email dispatch system for a U.S.-based startup.</li>
  <li>Created compelling scripts and teaching aids for unique educational concepts.</li>
  <li>Established an in-house monitoring system for 10,000 students and over 100 schools.</li>
  <li>Revitalized a decade-old scholarship system for improved efficiency and transparency.</li>
  <li>Shaped a curriculum that was adopted by the Delhi Government.</li>
  <li>Orchestrated multiple data collection and analysis exercises.</li>
  <li>Developed an innovative human development-centric impact assessment program for residential training, a one-of-its-kind initiative.</li>
  <li>Played a pivotal role in designing a mobile tools workshop to expand outreach in rural areas.</li>
  <li>Collaborated on the development and delivery of STEM curriculum, kits, and sessions.</li>
  <li>Contributed to R&amp;D efforts to enhance content for tablet-based learning.</li>
  <li>Embarked on a 7-month journey promoting STEM education in a unique train-based initiative.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what’s on your mind?</p>

<p>Please don’t think that your project is mundane or boring.</p>

<p>I have a knack for turning boring things into interesting.<br />
That’s my work.</p>

<p>Relax and <a href="/#contact-me">write to me</a></p>

<p>See you!</p>
