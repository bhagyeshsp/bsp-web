  <div class="post-content">
    <p>What they say, even the atheists also believe in something. And they make that a religion. Because it is in the human nature to believe in something. We simply can’t help it. Belief maketh bread.</p>

<p>This NEED to believe in something doesn’t have to be animalistic. We, the modern human beings, developed neocortex 2-3 million years back. We are literally blessed with higher-order (opposite of lower-order, animalistic) thinking. Our need to believe and act on something other than fear, food and mating has refined.</p>

<p>But the NEED to believe in something cannot be eliminated. And I’m not proposing that we eliminate. So what do we do? Fill our brains with the most abundant, “unquestioned” beliefs of our time. That’s where enters the “ideology” — a term that originally meant “science of ideas”. Until it got captured by irrational mob.</p>

<p>Every decade and century had their own irrational mobs.</p>

<p>We have ours.</p>

<p>The mobs of our time insist on being politically correct, not just correct. The mobs of our time insist on being inclusive, at the expense of being exclusive. The mobs of our time insist on being open, at the threat of being ostracized. The mobs of our time insist on diverse culture, by spreading monoculture . The mobs of our time insist on being equitable, at the expense of cutting our own limbs. The mobs of our time insist on being scientific, at the expense of science. The mobs of our time insist on shared future, at the expense of family. The mobs of our time insist on social cohesion, at the behest of social boycott. The mobs of our time insist on innovation, at the expense of free-thinkers. The mobs of our time revere group identity and sacrifice individual identity.</p>

<p>That is exactly what happened at Google and several thousand other companies. But there is only one Google, so it’s visible when anything significant happens.</p>

<p>In this article David says: The threat from AI will come less from “perpetuating existing biases in the world” and more from “injecting the biases and ideology of its overseers”.</p>

<p>Find this and other related articles in the comments.</p>

<p>But mainly, I want to talk about your organization. Look at your organization. It may not be Google, Apple or Meta. You may not be working on a laughing-stock-far-from-reality Gemini AI.</p>

<p>But self-diagnose, whether your product, your people, your culture, is not mimicking what Google’s Gemini AI was doing.</p>

<p>The outsiders may not know, because your product may not be generating some DEI-mandated AI Art. It may not be obvious: black and white.</p>

<p>Have a hard look.</p>

<p>Your organization, your product: do they reflect your best capacity?<br />
Your organization, your product: do they serve the people you claim to serve?<br />
Your organization, your product: are you really in charge?</p>
