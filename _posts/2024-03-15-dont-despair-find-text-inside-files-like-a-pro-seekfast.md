Reader, sometimes, we come across software applications that we didn’t know we needed.

A few weeks back I sent you a letter titled: [Instantly search your whole PC using Everything Search](https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/instantly-search-your-whole-pc-using-everything-search/) It focused on finding files and folders with matching names.

But today, we will go a step deeper and talk about a free tool that has made my life easy for the past several years. It helps me **find words in text files**: MS Word, PDF, you name it!

It’s called [SeekFast](https://seekfast.org/download-seekfast)​

And yes, it is available for MacOS if you want.

### The steps

Once you download SeekFast, just follow these steps.

Thanks to the tool’s help page, they have provided a concise visual help guide which I’m reproducing as it is:

### Free version limitation

The free version is powerful enough to meet most of the normal search needs. A free version lets you search for 50 files at a time. So, what I do is, I search in individual folders where I suspect my desired files are.

Most of the time, I just need a couple of attempts to save me from reworking something from scratch.

### Right inside your menu

I like how SeekFast integrates with our folder searches. All I need to do is right-click on the folder I suspect my desired files are and click the SeekFast icon.

I love Paul’s essays. This one particularly is close to my heart.

He rightly says that if you ask someone for advice on [how to do great work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) and the answer is “work hard”, it’s empty advice. Because hard work is the bare minimum requirement to do something worthwhile. There is no substitute. But that’s not the point of this essay, it is fun to go through his thought process on “how to” do the hard work.

I hope you enjoy reading this one as much as I did.
