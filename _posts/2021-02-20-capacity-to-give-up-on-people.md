This is important.

The conventional wisdom stresses on not giving up on people. It talks about giving chance after chance. If one way doesn’t work, offer another. Course correct.

When it comes to managing people, there is a limit to the trial and error process. If the manager is clear about what s/he is looking for in a person, it becomes even more cumbersome.

Humans have a natural instinct to maintain their inertia. It is phrased normally as ‘people don’t change much’. Yes, they don’t, but we don’t operate from this premise in our relationships. The tiny hope of change in a person hampers our decision making.

This hope and conventional wisdom *lessens our capacity to give up on people*.

A manager’s less capacity of giving up on people results in mediocrity, or worse: rewarding mediocrity.

Organizations need to have people who are clear about what they’re looking for in people.

A clarity linked with a *high capacity to give up on people* serves two purposes: organization prospers and the individuals find their work fulfilling.

And what about the ill-suited individuals?: they do not self-sabotage and find something that suites them.
