You’re set for a disappointment if you seriously thought Steve Jobs conducted any team-building activity.

So what he did?

Made an offer that a handful of crazy ones couldn’t resist.

The non-believers didn’t believe and he didn’t care.

Have you listened to [Sir Jonathan Ive’s interview](https://www.realisedesign.co.uk/uk-product-design-blog/apples-english-designer-jony-ive-the-future-of-design/)? He is the former Chief Design Officer of Apple Inc. As you carefully listen to him during this 50-minute long talk, you realize the team-building activity. There is none. He is not using such platitudes during the entire interview.

So what’s on offer at Apple?

An offer to make a difference, to have fun and manifest your vision. The individuals had to self-organize and leave their differences aside. They had to stick around long enough for years to manifest their vision. Team-building remained just a by-product in the grand scheme of things.

If we look closely, team-building activities, trust-building activities, and empathy exercises are a part of a strategic product to be sold by a certain group of people. A group of people without any accountability.

Because these things are hard to measure.

If I can’t measure, I can’t hold you accountable.
