If you’re a fan of suspense thriller movies like me, you’d have seen one of these [murder maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_board) in some scenes. (I didn’t know it is called that until now)

What I love about those boards is, how easy it is for a viewer to understand what is going on. No matter how complicated the movie storyline.

Right?

This leads to one of my favorite things: explaining things. I mean I just can’t let go of that instinct. And over the years, I have mostly used pen and paper. In recent years, I have tried flowcharting, cartooning, spreadsheeting, Jam-boarding, etc.

But something has always been lacking.

### The murder map feeling

When you try to explain your project, your work, or a problem to your colleague, or an audience of 50 people, if you can’t make them feel “click”, you would know that. I’m calling it a murder map feeling. Murder maps are so widespread due to movies that, people just get dragged into them.

### Consider this

Which of the following depictions would interest you?

It is natural to be drawn toward the image on the right-hand side. It has photos, non-distracting arrows, and a feeling. A feeling of relatability.

### So, murder maps for presentations?

Of course not! But I have been tinkering with this free tool that has all the elements that make presenting complex information easy to depict. More real than standard flow charts or jam boards.

Try this free tool by visiting https://excalidraw.com

Ironically, I’m not providing any steps for this. It is quite self-explanatory and fun to play around. But if you hit a roadblock, let me know.

Give it a try and let me know how you like it.

If you are using any other tool, **Hit Reply** and share it with me.
