So, I got the idea of sharing a reading roundup in August when I was traveling and trying to write a letter. And couldn’t write anything. That’s when I came up with [My Swades movie moment and reading roundup](https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/tfn14-%f0%9f%93%9a-my-swades-movie-moment-and-reading-roundup/)​

So, it has been approximately 6 months, and here we go again.

Between the reading roundup in August and last week’s letter, I have been able to share 47 hand-picked articles with you. If you’re new or curious about the past issues, you may want to go to the [archive](https://bhagyeshpathak.com/).

In any case, sharing some 13 pieces out of those 47 here:
