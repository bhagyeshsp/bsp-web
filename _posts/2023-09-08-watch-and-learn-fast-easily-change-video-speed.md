Did you know YouTube releases a Culture and Trends report every year?

I didn’t know.

I recently read its [2023 report](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/YouTube_Culture__Trends_Report_2023.pdf). Fascinating!

Almost everyone who has an internet connection consumes some or the other type of video content.

I learned that there are four major formats of videos: Long-form, short-form, live videos, and video podcasts.

When I read it, I realized I mostly watch long-form content and podcasts.

This reminded me of a tool that I have been using for the last 2 years.

It has completely changed the way I watch any video.

Especially learning videos
--------------------------

Yes.

I can’t tell you how useful it has been to watch a slow instructor explain something at 2x-3x speed on YouTube, Coursera, edX, or any other platform.

Or slow down a speedy video presenter to match my speed.

You get the idea.

Doesn’t every platform provide speed controllers?
-------------------------------------------------

They do.

But how often do you use them?

Not much, because it requires 4-5 clicks to adjust video speed.

And by the time you do that, your interest vanishes.

This comes in handy as a Chrome extension.

It runs in the background.

When installed, it appears as a translucent tile within a video.

By default keyboard shortcuts:

**V =** appear/disappear the control panel

**Z =** 10 seconds backwards

**X =** 10 seconds forwards

**S =** Increase speed by 0.10x

**D =** Decrease speed by 0.10x

That’s it!

### But I use just two keys:

G and R.

**G =** jumps speed to 1.5x

**R =** resets speed to 1x

You can modify the settings in the extension through this window.

I have used this extension to digest 30-minute-long Coursera videos in 15-20 minutes.

It is truly a life-saver tool.

So Reader, do you use any tool that you’d like to share with me?

I can share it with a larger audience in upcoming editions.

How does a report look like when tech-giant YouTube prepares a report? Apart from their analysis, it is interesting how they have laid out the whole report in an easily understandable format. They have included stories wherever applicable.

I couldn’t complete reading this sickening Wired article. Talking of culture, this is how low journalism has fallen. While it continues its fall in the Orwellian future, we need to recognize our values and solidify them. Every void gets filled with the next available matter.

I think I need to begin writing on such topics in a dedicated newsletter publication. **What’s your opinion? Should I do it?**
