No, we’re not talking about artificial ear creation from stem cells. But a metaphorical one.

The thing is, communication platforms have made it easy to voice out your mind. But every progress asks for something in return. In this case, we have given up our ears. Our eyes. Our observation skills.

That is why it is essential that we acknowledge the need to develop a listening attitude—an open heart.

If you’re a manager, a facilitator, or a marketer, you need to pause once in a while. Listen to what the customer is saying. Which pain points they are voicing out.

It is easy to mistake social media stats to take on their face value. Not all data says something. It is we who try to weave a story around it.

If you want to improve your offering, listening to the customer is the single most powerful choice you can make.
