Most of us fear both. And these are not the only fears that we harbor.

Consider a few examples:  
The fear of a cold shower vs the fear of presenting a ppt deck

The fear of a knife cut vs the fear of your ideas being rejected

The fear of falling off a cliff vs the fear of being vulnerable

You get the idea.

It may seem that the fears are unrelated. And they may be. But lately, I’m observing something interesting. The determination to face a physical fear is transferrable to psychological harm-based fears too. In essence, you can cultivate the strength to face fears.

This observation has led me to an immediate realization: I can’t expect to fight anxiety before an important presentation if I’m not fighting my fear of a dog bite on a daily basis. Small things count.

Until we learn to face our physical fears willingly, we can’t learn to face our psychological fears. That extra push of determination seeps through all of our decisions. This means, if you learn it in one area of life, you can instantly use it in another area.
