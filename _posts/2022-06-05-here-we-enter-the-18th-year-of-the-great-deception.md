While some of us torment ourselves on the eve of world environment day, a little bit of fact-check is in order.

As an individual, what should be our share of the blame for greenhouse gas emissions? : 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 5%?

In 2020, when the world was at a standstill, the world contributed approximately 8% fewer greenhouse emissions. Just an 8% decrease. Who contributed for the rest of 92%?

We know who.

British Petroleum (BP) is the world’s second-largest oil and gas production company. It popularised the concept of carbon footprint in 2004. Thanks to their powerful global PR campaign. BP convinced our teachers, our children, and our working class that it was we who were responsible for the emissions. We took the blame.

Definitely, we should be mindful of our life choices. But, when Google Flights shows me that my round trip is going to produce 130 kg CO2, do we ask BP how many trillion kg of CO2 they’re going to dump for every new oil rig they’re sanctioned to drill?

This individual responsibility deception prevents any actionable policy-level dialogue.

If my company is in financial trouble, who will face the axe first? Of course, the ones who are drawing the most amount of money. It is more sensible to save several hundred thousand by axing 5 high salary ones than 50 low salary ones.

BP and the entire industry are the high volume ones.

I hope that as we enter the 18th year of carbon footprint deception, we truly mature and shift the focus where the real action is lacking.
