Shipping work is hard.  
Making it public is even harder.

For past few months, I have been tinkering with something. And if you remember, a few weeks back, I shared an essay “To AI or Not To AI” too.\[1\] How to make the best of the technology without making it spammy.

So, this is one of the use cases in my work: helping teachers plan better.

This fictional Sisyphus Valley School has an Atal Tinkering Lab (ATL) setup. If you didn’t know, India has now 10,000 ATL Labs setup across the nation.\[2\]

The guiding curriculum is good enough to start, but teachers need an extra hand in creating activities that meet their constraints. So, what’s the solution?

ATL AI Assistant.

This AI assistant has a copy of all three levels of ATL curriculum books. So, when a teacher consults this assistant, it by-default receives the exact context–without teacher explicitly sharing.

Context info such as: class size, session duration, idea brief and ATL session that the teacher wants to undertake.

I’m creating a video overview. Meanwhile, sharing a few screenshots.

And oh yes, there are more assistant use cases for the Sisyphus Valley School. I will share them as I get some dedicated time.

THE BOTTOMLINE:  
We don’t need to think of (and consequently, fear of) an AI Robo Teacher in our schools. AI is here to help us create hyper-contextual, hyper-personalized learning experiences.
