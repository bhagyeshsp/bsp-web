I don’t know Reader, whether you got a chance to go through the **Golden Ratio** newsletter last week, but I want to share something that I always love sharing: a tool!

A **tool for sharing confidential information** with one or more people.

No, it’s not WhatsApp.

Let me share with you a little **backstory first**.

A few months back, I ran into some software problems. And I contacted customer support. The customer care professional was based in the Philippines. We were chatting through their built-in chat support.

After 30 minutes of “try this and try that”, he understood that he would need my website credentials. To fix on his own. (If you’re wondering, no, he couldn’t fix the problem. Neither could his entire team. I had to figure it out on my own. Haha..)

He asked me to share my credentials using [1time.app](https://1time.app) with an expiration time of 48 hours. So that he could pass the credentials to his other team members if required in the next two days.

I shared my credentials. It took me just one minute!

No back-and-forth. I was reassured my credential link would expire in 48 hours and **wouldn’t live in anyone’s email system**.

I have been using it since then for multiple things. Even for surprises.

For example, there’s a joke in [**this link**](https://1time.app/secret/cyYVKdsiabrgyUuyc7nhYIvdlnv8UR6bNuY8gucT). The password is: **whocares123**

And yes, the link will **self-destruct** in 48 hours.

How to use it?
--------------

Let me give you a quick walkthrough.

### 1. Go to [1time.app](https://1time.app)​

No login is required.

### 3. Write your confidential message

It can be anything from your credentials, important document links, address, contact info, or anything.

Anything that you want to share with an expiration date on it.

Also, modify the password and expiration time if you want to. Or else leave them as they are.

### 4. Create the private link

As soon as you hit the blue button to create a private link, the link will be generated and you can copy it.

Jason and David are great communicators.

So, how do they communicate in their organization? Fascinating read.
