It takes a village to raise a child.

And what about a business, a project or a service?

It is good to assume that success is dependent on the village and villagers.

The thing is, in the case of raising a child, the village plays a passive role and parents donâ€™t get to choose their villages.

But while building an organization, if we make a mistake in choosing the village and villagers, the business suffers.

You need to decide which one is your village and who you want to be your villagers.

Needless to say, so do your friends and mental consumption. Mental villagers.
