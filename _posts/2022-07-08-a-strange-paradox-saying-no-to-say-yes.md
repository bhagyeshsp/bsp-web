Every one of us needs to build the capacity to say NO. Not for ourselves. But to serve better.

A bit paradoxical, huh?

See, you might be a teacher, a marketer, an investment banker or a CEO. No matter what, you want to serve your customer, and your organization better. Better than yesterday.

The industrial era is on the decline. We no longer need people who wait for directions. The world needs people who are clear enough to say NO to commands. And propose a better ROI.

For example, suppose you’re building a marketing strategy for your client. If you say YES to everything, there are three major reasons why you might be doing so:

1\. Fear of losing the client

2\. Having no expertise

3\. Having no other clients

When you look closely at these reasons, developing your capability to say NO will do miracles. Not only for you but also for your client.

Good organizations want competent people. This is not an assumption, it is a fact. A cheap organization will bargain at every little decision point: price, features, timelines, responsibilities, salary etc. A great organization helps you become the best in your class: an effective teacher, a better marketer, and an insightful investment banker.

Don’t fall for the trap of budget and priorities. If I’m running an organization, I want the best people. Or at least the people who have options. People who can say NO but choose to work with me.

A long schooling indoctrination has made it hieratical to develop an ability to say NO. While the opposite is true in the real world. In fact, society rewards it.

So, what actions are you taking to develop your capacity to say NO?
