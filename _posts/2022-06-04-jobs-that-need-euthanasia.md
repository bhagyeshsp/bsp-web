Yes, mercy killing. We should think about many jobs that need euthanasia.

While chatting with my friend the other day, we stumbled upon the situation of 10-minute delivery agents. A lot has been written, discussed and criticized about this pervasive practice by wanna-be Unicorns. I have been guilty of being on the receiving end of their services.

But, here is the take:

When I’m hopeless, or in this case, job-less, I will cling to the thinnest branch of hope. And that’s what some of these job roles do to the youth. They didn’t choose to enrol for this job. We have provided them with such a choice matrix where the best choice they could make was to rent out their time for almost nothing. Their mistake: not having the right guidance, the right opportunity at the right time. Which is not event their mistake.

My list of jobs that need mercy killing:

- 10-minute delivery agent
- Spam telecaller (Credit card, broadband, domain etc.)
- Valet

The argument that the job provides someone bread is full of fallacy. Sometimes hypocrisy.

As a society, we need replacement jobs that provide meaning and better wages.
