And the ideas that we don’t own.

Will you hit the kill switch on your idea, if it doesn’t work?

It is important to differentiate between which are ours and which are borrowed.

There are multiple reasons why it is important to differentiate:

- To control our attachment to the idea and stay objective
- To get generous feedback on the idea and be receptive
- To improve the idea and help it grow
- To manifest the idea and gift it to others
- To get help without vanity
- And of course, to hit the kill switch

Start tracing back and you will be shocked at how little original we are.
