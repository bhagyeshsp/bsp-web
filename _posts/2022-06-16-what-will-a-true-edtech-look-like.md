The best Edtech we had for a hundred years was a blackboard and chalk.

Then, we thought “alright, let’s scale the same experience using digital tools.”

We failed.

Many organizations tried to position themselves as the substitute for the traditional classroom. While the better idea was to be an augmentation for learning.

We need a couple of more decades for the technology to catch up.

What I mean by that:

– In the next 50 years: A company such as Neuralink should be able to provide a safe computer-brain interface. It will detect the user’s reflexes to provide spatial and neuro-muscular data

– In the meanwhile, the VR technology will be affordable and non-intrusive. The user will find it difficult to differentiate between reality and simulated reality

– Also in the meanwhile, the Metaverse would be in the phase where Facebook was in the 2010s

At a medium level of sophistication, these technologies will provide the students with what we call a true EdTech experience.
