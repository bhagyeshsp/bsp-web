The other day, my friend told me about the latest online scam tactic. In this tactic, the scammer poses as a police/CBI/Narcotics official and grills their victim for hours. Eventually, their victim pays some heavy amount of money and gets scammed.

But this one never gets old:

Thatâ€™s one of the famous versions of the **Nigerian Prince Scam**.

If youâ€™re anything like me, and read all the versions of the Nigerian Prince Scam, you will laugh until your cheeks hurt.

I mean why would people believe in such types of emails?

They shouldnâ€™t. But still, thousands of people believe such emails/calls every day.

But why not you or me?

### Are we special?

If you laughed after reading the Nigerian princeâ€™s email, we know something for sure:

Youâ€™re not the scammerâ€™s ideal audience (*victim*).

Because:

- Youâ€™re not foolish to believe in such emails
- You know online scams are real
- Youâ€™re digitally literate
- You noticed something fishy
- You noticed that the email has a couple of typos
- Youâ€™re not greedy
- You donâ€™t believe in get-rich-quick schemes

Still, as we know, every day thousands of people get scammed by Nigerian Prince tactic.

That means the scammerâ€™s ideal audience would:

- Be naive and overly trusting
- Have little or no idea of online scams
- Be digitally inexperienced
- Be off-the guard
- Be too distracted to notice the typos and awkward phrasing
- Be financially in trouble or naturally greedy
- Believe in get-rich-quick schemes

### Thatâ€™s called audience persona

The Nigerian Prince scammers have an ideal type of audience in their minds. And we just outlined their audienceâ€™s characterization. Thatâ€™s called audience persona.

In this case, we can call it their **victimâ€™s persona**.

Now, Iâ€™m not going to say that all of us are like the Nigerian Prince in our work.

But we certainly need to create some audience persona in our work.

### Letâ€™s take an example.

If youâ€™re creating an online survey, youâ€™d want to know a few things to make your survey as smooth as possible.

Youâ€™d want to understand your userâ€™s persona.

**For example:**

- Do they understand English?
- Are they comfortable operating a smartphone?
- Is there good internet connectivity?
- When are they free to fill in your survey?
- What is their reading level?

### List and Template

There are several types of persona depending on your needs.

Here, Iâ€™m sharing a looong list of parameters along with a filled template.

You donâ€™t need to use all the parameters, ideally 15-20 would work for most use cases.

So, have you ever received any Nigerian Princeâ€™s email?

What was your first reaction?

**Hit Reply** and share it with me.

Donâ€™t worry, I answer all the emails because there are not that many emails to answer.ðŸ˜„
