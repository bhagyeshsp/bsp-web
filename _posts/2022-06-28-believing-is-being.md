Most of us tend to believe what we see. For us, being is believing.

The problem occurs when we start working on large projects. We have to believe in the project, its outcomes and its eventual being. We cannot wait for the being, the existence to manifest to make us believe in it.

If your team or your customers donâ€™t believe in your future, it is unlikely that you will manifest that being.

This is where the role of visionaries comes into play. These visionaries paint a picture of the future so clearly that the listener can see the future being. That turns the non-believers into believers.

As an organization or an individual, we have to make sure that we are painting the right future.

A future that people can see right now.

A future that people anticipate.
