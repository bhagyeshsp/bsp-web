But we want to begin with digital sketch on a high-end iPad Pro device, and call it a day.

The attachment to traditional pencil and paper as tools is not romantic or nostalgic one. It is about understanding all the different nuances of the sketch, the friction of the lead with paper, the instant feedback and the fine-tuning of hand muscles etc.

The transition from a wooden pencil to a digital pencil is a process. A worthwhile one. An artist who has had gone through the pencil and paper process is sure to have an edge over the one who has never gone through.

On our work front, all of us are guilty of skipping the line. We purchase and install tens of productivity apps on our devices. Track our work and pray it will help increasing productivity or collaboration.

The problem is, we are looking for a technological solution. While the challenge is humane.

Technology can not provide answers to how to manage our time, our priorities or when to drop that “I heard about your loss, we are all with you” note to a grieving colleague.

This does not mean technology cannot help in managing our day. It already is.

The problem arises when we outsource our responsibility to a to-do list tracking application.

There is no alternative to human spirit. Let’s begin with a pencil and a paper. Always.
