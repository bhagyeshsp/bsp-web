Last week, you saw my love for Markdown. And this week, I recruit more comrades! ðŸ˜„  
If you missed last weekâ€™s letter, quickly skim through it so you know what we are discussing in todayâ€™s letter.  
We will talk about a web app called Dillinger. Dillinger helps us write and preview markdown. We can export files in different formats too. We will use Dillinger to save ChatGPTâ€™s responses in various formats.

Dillinger: free, no sign-up app
-------------------------------

I donâ€™t use Dillinger daily, but if you want to learn markdown quickly and intuitively, it is the best choice.  
So, no matter whichever browser youâ€™re on, go to [https://dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/)â€‹  
Dillinger starts with an in-built example to help us understand how markdown works. If you want to learn the basics more, go to [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)â€‹

This is how Dillingerâ€™s screen looks:

The interface is self-explanatory.  
Type on the left, live preview on the right.  
You can go through the whole example.

Save ChatGPT conversation in a file
-----------------------------------

One of the best uses of Markdown and this Dillinger app is to save ChatGPT responses in your favourite file formats, for example: PDF.

I asked ChatGPT to generate a document for our example:

![2.2.png](https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/sy9yExGskATgXjjxGGJrBo)

â€‹

Then I copy pasted it in Dillinger:

â€‹

I hit export as PDF:

â€‹

And the PDF is ready!

Find the full document [here](https://download.filekitcdn.com/d/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/68o9Byk5hmwnVAkKYTzW91).

Sharing the screenshot:

So now we have a PDF file, respecting all the original formatting made by ChatGPT. Even the code block is also shown.

We learn when we apply
----------------------

If you think about it, copy-pasting ChatGPT responses is not exactly learning Markdown. But as you keep using it, you will want to make edits to the document. And thatâ€™s how we can learn by applying ourselves.

Tell me something, do you save your ChatGPT conversations anywhere? How?

In this refreshing piece, Jason talks about a simple way to look at customer service or any interpersonal relationship. There are two tokens on a table when a customer complains. Which token would you pick?
