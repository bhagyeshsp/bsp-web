When a bookworm walks into your small book cafe.

When a patient enters your operation theatre.

When a tired parent knocks on the headmasterâ€™s door.

When a new fearful child enters your classroom.

When a farmer visits your organic startup webpage.

When a veteran reads your company and job description.

Does it make them feel hopeful, empowered, creative or any noteworthy positive feeling?

Then you have done a good job.

If not, you know which levers to shift.
