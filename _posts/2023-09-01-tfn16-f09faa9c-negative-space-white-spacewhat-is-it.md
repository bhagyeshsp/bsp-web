Hi dear reader,

In my last letter, we saw the comparison of different online writing platforms. The internet is full of so many options that it is easy to get lost while deciding where to begin. I hope it has been useful.

If you remember, two months back, we had talked on the topic: [Like most people, do you also think you’re not a designer?](https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/like-most-people-do-you-also-think-youre-not-a-designer/)​

I want to talk on similar lines in this letter.

As a knowledge worker, when you create a document, a report, or a presentation, what do you set out to accomplish?

To change your boss’ mind. Or your team’s mind. Right?

Most of the time, you can’t change someone’s mind by adding more to a document.

In fact, you have to use “negative space” or “white space” to engage them.

Once they’re engaged, their mind becomes receptive to what you want to say.

We will see how to do that in a minute.
