According to [www.deathclock.com](http://www.deathclock.com), I have 60 more years to live.

To breathe.

To enjoy the human experience.

You can check yours. But the deathclock is not going to show infinity. Neither it is going to show 200 years.

We have a choice to make here.

Either to live as if there is no tomorrow, or as if there is tomorrow.

A certain tomorrow. Which needs your generous contribution.

Your legacy.

Your impact.

Your gift.
