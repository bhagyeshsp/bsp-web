“Please treat this space as a safe space, you can be vulnerable here”, said the facilitator of the online workshop. Though well-intentioned, it doesn’t inspire action. Despite knowing it doesn’t work that way, we resort to it. We repeatedly say it and make it uninspiring.

Stating a fact is not the key to inspiration. The key to inspiration is emotion. Engage your target’s emotion. This applies everywhere: relationships, marketing, interviews or design.

And how can we engage emotions?

Create a stable environment reflecting your intention. Get everyone onboard. Don’t tell your intention. Manifest the presence of your intention through your actions. If required, coordinate the initial actions for building the momentum. Then step back.

It’s not easy, but worth the effort.
