Probably the ATM machines taught people the possibility of an unsupervised queue.

All engineering projects affect a lasting change. On the society. Of course, most of them are unintentional.

Sometimes it takes us decades to realize this.

Few examples:

- Telecom projects: changed the society’s communication pattern
- Infrastructure projects: changed the society’s demographics
- Transportation projects: changed the society’s supply-chain
- Social media projects: changed the society’s internal dialogue
- Banking technology projects: changed the society’s currency transactions
- Energy projects: changed the society’s living conditions
- Education projects: changed the knowledge gap
- Defence projects: changed the society’s toleration threshold
- Agriculture tech projects: changed the society’s consumption pattern

Imagine what we can accomplish if we undertake all engineering projects with an intentional inclusion or exclusion of the social engineering part.
