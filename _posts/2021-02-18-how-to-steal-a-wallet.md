We are all trying to do it. More often than not, we fail at it. Repeatedly. We throw our hands in air, concluding not everyone has a talent of sleight of hand.

The truth is, sleight of hand is a skill. Learnable and transferable.

Of course, the wallet in the question here is not an actual wallet. But more valuable than a wallet. We try to gain attention, trust, commitment or care. Either for us or for people working together.

When we tell people that weâ€™re going to steal their wallets. What happens? Resistance arises. This resistance is the hindrance.

The key is to make them comfortable, give them space and let the sleight of hand work its magic.

It works. Every time.
