This is my favourite bunch. Poetic, confident, incisive.

We know them as “experts”.

The problem crops up when you put them to the real-life test. Most of them underperform. Or better: they’re good theorists.

Universities are producing a huge number of jargon-filled experts nowadays.

So, how do you identify a potential expert from the rest?

I use the following heuristic:

Step-1: Listen to them without interruption. Look for jargon. Do they substitute jargon when a simple word could be used?

Step-2: Ask them why questions. Socratic line of questioning.

Step-3: If step-2 is satisfactory, ask for their personal experience. Experience that supports their reasoning.

Outcome: You will know if you have a genuine expert or a jargon guy in front of you.

If it’s a jargon guy, enjoy the poems.
