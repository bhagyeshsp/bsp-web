And that’s remarkable.

I recently switched to Bluehost’s one of the products and needed to call them multiple times for initial setup.

No customer-care call queues, no excuse about covid-crisis.

The customer representatives were patient, unassuming and solved every problem that I could throw at them.

To the uninitiated, Bluehost is one of the largest web hosting companies available today. Hence, one may argue about their financial might behind such customer service. It may be. But, that’s an easy answer. We need to dig deeper and not satisfy ourselves with overly simplistic explanations and mono-causal reasoning.

While money is required to hire someone who is skilled at what they’re supposed to do, but it proves an ineffective motivator for genuine care, ownership, and responsibility. And, more often than not, these are the things that translate to remarkability.

Throughout the human history, ‘being remarkable’ has been important and there is no reason to think it does not matter now.

Commitment to be remarkable takes work. It takes willingness to fail, to be a fool.

It takes practice.

If you have committed to showing up at 10 o’clock on Monday morning meeting and if you do, it is remarkable.

When you ship your work on time with the quality that was agreed upon, that too is remarkable.

In essence, being remarkable takes courage. It is worth aiming for.
