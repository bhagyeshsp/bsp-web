The idea is simple: learn to see reality as it is.

Were you expecting a different behaviour to happen?

Did it happen?

Why did or didnâ€™t it happen?

What part of your thesis was correct or incorrect?

This may seem like a no-brainer, but how many of us deal with our realities in this manner?

Once you boil it down to reality, embracing it becomes easy.

This acceptance decreases the distance between your expectation and reality = reduced suffering.
