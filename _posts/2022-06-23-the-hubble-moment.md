I’m eagerly waiting for the first full-colour images from JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) scheduled to be publicized on July 12th. If you’re unaware of it, read the Wiki article [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope).

But I’m not talking about JWST, nor about The Hubble Telescope.

I’m talking about monumental projects.

Upon its launch in 1996, The Hubble Telescope was a monumental project for the entire scientific community.

Even the community knew that it was going to be a game-changer. That’s the thing about the Space industry. The projects are a bit predictable. In terms of competition. It is possible to know from the start that the project is going to be relevant and monumental. But it is difficult in other sectors.

In energy, material, telecom, infotech, FMCG etc, a ten-year future prediction is impossible.

So, what shall we do?

The only choice we have is to work on our projects. Launch them. And work on the next one. And then the next one.

This practice increases our chances of producing projects that might become The Hubble of the industry. And may affect the course of discussion.

Which of your project bets is going to be the next Hubble moment?
