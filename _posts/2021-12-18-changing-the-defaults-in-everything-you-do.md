I dislike pre-installed applications on smartphones or computers. You can’t even remove some of them. The majority of them are ineffective at what they do. The fact that some of the third-party apps come pre-installed as a part of the deal is a signal that there are not many takers.

For example, most of us do not use Microsoft’s by-default Internet Explorer. We know that it is slow and dated. What do we do? Google Chrome! We know what works for us and what is good for us.

Similar to any gadget, when we get in a new work engagement or project commitment, we sign up for the whole, not the part. We say yes to the people, processes, and culture. Many people get it wrong past this line. The line of signing the contract. They think that the deal is set in stone. That their commitment is unchangeable. But, in reality, the deal is no different than purchasing a new gadget. The maker wants you to make amends as you find fit. There is always room for modification. We can always change the defaults. If the system doesn’t allow it, there are many other systems that would be requiring your time and contribution.

If you study a newly signed-up project and come across some defaults, note them. Characterize them. Just because the defaults were set before you entered, doesn’t mean you have to accept them as they are. What you’re expected is to suggest a change. Stand up. Advocate. Or write a memo. But, not to accept the default setting. Especially, if the default setting does more harm than good.

Every project and human interaction comes with many default settings. It is up to us to negotiate the modification.
