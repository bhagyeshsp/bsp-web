The gimmick of “we are a flat organization” got perpetuated when Facebook in 2015 began its operations with probably the largest open office floor plan in the world. Many of the tech-giants followed the suite.

It’s not that open offices didn’t exist before 21st century. But I’m more interested in the time that I’m living. We’re living.

Now that you’ve already read the opening of this article, you know that I’m little interested in pros an cons of “flat organizations”. Because I believe it is nothing more than a gimmick, a fad, a “we’re Sillicon-Valley-Cool signalling”.

So, what’s my contention?

The trope of “we’re a flat organization” portrays the concept of hierarchy, an evil. (Add to that post-modernist radicalism of opposing anything that is competent and orderly)

Hierarchy is an order. An organization is an order.

Of course, not even for a minute, I’m suggesting that hierarchy for the sake of power-tripping is good. It is the lowest form of pleasure one can get. So, that’s out of question.

When people pretend that there is no hierarchy in their organization, they’re signalling one of the following dysfunctions:

- No one is held accountable
- Only a selected few are held accountable
- No decision is ever made
- Only a selected few are marred by making decisions for everyone else

Hierarchy is a logical conclusion of decision-making process. If you can’t put your organization’s decision-making processes in an order, there is a disorder. Anarchy.

So, the next time someone claims that they have no hierarchy in their organization, ask this: “can you make the decision on behalf of your CEO?”

What has been your experience around this?  
Have you been at a receiving end of this gimmick? Did it feel empowering or helpless?
