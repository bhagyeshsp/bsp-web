Last night, I attended Y Combinator’s session on Boom Supersonic jet startup. (Boom is building a commercial Supersonic jet that will travel two times faster than today’s commercial jets. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_Technology).)

Boom’s founder Blake was showing around their testing prototype XB-1 Baby Boom at their hanger. YC’s president Geoff Ralston was conversing with Blake on the model, its build, the technology etc.

One thing during the live tour and the following interview that was apparent was Blake’s clarity about Boom’s vision. His clarity was reflected in the way he was weaving each of his explanations and answers.

That’s the thing about clarity. If you have it, it’s like crystal clear glass. People can see through other noise and appreciate your commitment.

Today’s knowledge worker, entrepreneur, teacher or software engineer’s job is to be as clear as possible.

- Why are we doing what we are doing?
- Why are we not doing what we are supposed to be doing?
- Where can I add the highest value?
- Where are we headed?

These are important questions. Most of the folks try to keep the glass dusty. The dust keeps them feel safe and comfortable and most importantly, the dust allows us to aim low. No consequences.

But, many times an inconsequential life turns out to be an unhelpful life. Which kills the meaning out of life.
