Recently, I visited a handicrafts market. Classic jute items, ceramics, soaps, embroidery. You get the idea.

I felt as if I was underpaying for a ceramic mug. The price was too less for so much of their efforts. If I had crafted such a mug, I wouldn’t sell it at any price.

And still, the artist detaches him/herself from their creations. They gift their art at a meagre price so that the world can become a little more bright, a little more joyful.

The good news is that we don’t need to start learning embroidery or ceramic painting. Or we don’t need to start purchasing from a local shop. I mean that’s great if you choose to do so.

But, we can become artists by gifting our work. Yes. A kind of work that makes the recipient feel: hopeful, optimistic and trustful.

Our definition of art may not match, but hey, the outcome matches!
