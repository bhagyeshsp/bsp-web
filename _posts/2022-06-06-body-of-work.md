Did Pandit Ravishankar have a resume? What about Richard Branson or Carl Sagan or Steven Spielberg?

Could they make a large impact because they didn’t have a resume? Or was it a conscious choice?

We don’t know the answer.  
But we do know these great personalities produced a body of work over the years. So compelling that you can’t ignore them.

They concentrated on the projects at hand. One project finished, they shifted to another. They became prolific at what they were good at.

One of the ways to be remarkable at what you do is to think in terms of a portfolio and not a resume.

If you do, you will not need a resume. Also, you would not require to resume as you will never pause.
