Threshold is not a good measure. Probably not the right one too.

If you decide ‘we will act if the problem crosses so and so threshold’, you are more likely to cross that threshold.

Waiting until the system no longer works.

Waiting until the addiction reaches a point of no return.

Waiting until the climate changes irreversibly.

Waiting until our inspiration, the fire in our belly diminishes.

We wait because we think there is a threshold.

Waiting itself is a threshold. Imaginary one. Ever-expanding. Making us old, weak and ultimately dead.

The alternative is to replace waiting with something more tangible, more urgent.

Something that keeps us away from wishful thinking.
