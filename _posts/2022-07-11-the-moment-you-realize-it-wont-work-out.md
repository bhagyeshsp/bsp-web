That’s the moment all of us come across. Every day. No matter what kind of knowledge work we might be engaged in.

You enrolled a student in your after-school classes, but you know it won’t work out.

You agreed to run a social media campaign for a new client, but somewhere you know it won’t work out.

The moment of realization is not that important. But what is more important: what you choose to do after the realization.

Do you guide the child to a better-suited after-school course?

Do you redraw the terms of service with the client?

Do you take any action?
