Reader, If I start counting how many documents I have come across that have hand-made Table of Contents, it will take me a couple of days to finish counting.

But it is not their fault.

Because there is something inherently soo simple about text editors such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs that people take them for granted and use them for nothing but typing and styling the fonts.

But it doesn’t have to be this way.

Why it matters to me

Sure, the text styles look out of proportion. Not aesthetically pleasing.

But we can change the styles as per our taste.

The point is to do smart work.

Knowledge workers cannot afford to struggle with simple things such as Text Styling in text editors.

**So Reader**, do you use text styling in your regular work?

What is your observation about people using or not using such features?

**This week, I watched (without skipping a second) this refreshing podcast from Peter Boghossian (runtime 44 minutes).**

**I loved Dr. Dorian’s answers and found a new respect for the University of Chicago.**

*Some background before you dive into it:*

In 2021, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) [canceled](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/us/dorian-abbot-mit.html) a high-profile lecture by Dr. Dorian Abbot, a renowned geophysicist from the University of Chicago. The topic of the lecture was not the issue. Rather, Dorian was targeted by Social Justice activists because of his [critique](https://www.newsweek.com/diversity-problem-campus-opinion-1618419) of DEI ideology. MIT buckled to the demands of a handful of ideologues, inadvertently contributing to discussions about academic censorship.

MIT did not expect the blowback it received for hobbling scientific inquiry in favor of ideological conformity. MIT alumni formed the [Free Speech Alliance](https://www.mitfreespeech.org/) and its faculty overwhelmingly voted to adopt a university [statement](https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/sites/default/files/reports/2022-09_Proposed_MIT_Statement_on_Freedom_of_Expression_and_Academic_Freedom.pdf) regarding freedom of expression. Since then, Dorian has become a leading figure in the fight for academic freedom of thought, speech, and inquiry.

In this conversation, Peter Boghossian and Dorian discuss the MIT fiasco, the proper aim of academia, the immorality of DEI, speech as “violence,” University of Chicago’s commitment to academic freedom, finding meaning through religion and naturalism, Dorian’s rejection of tyrannical “equality” mandates, and much more.
