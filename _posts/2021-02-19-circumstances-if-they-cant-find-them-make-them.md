The internet has increased the social media reach. Especially to market the products or services. The conversion of a potential customer to a paying customer is uncertain. That’s where we play by statistics and hope for the best.

One thing that internet cannot help with is word of mouth. The small businesses aren’t well-equipped with a social media marketing strategy and more often than not, they do not require. For example: a local dry cleaning shop has to rely on word of mouth and customer loyalty.

I came across a recent incident which exemplifies what Shaw had once said.

A food-delivery agent showcased this extra-ordinary trait when he handed over his home appliances repair business card. Turns out that he was using the opportunity provided by the food-delivery company to come in contact with customers living in 5 km radius.

This is an ingenious idea. The delivery agent has identified the opportunity to build relations and spread the word in organic manner.

The world is full of people who push the boundaries to create the circumstances and make the magic happen.
