Reader, I don’t know about you, but I used to hate Diwali homework during my school life. Whoever invented it, must have a natural talent to suck joy out of leisure.

My Diwali homework assignments used to carry things like “write the answers to the selected questions twice” or/and “prepare some list of mathematical formulas on a chart paper”.

Constant anxiety-laden time.

I hope they’re not torturing kids that way any longer.

So, I thought to share a **selected list of readings** for the holiday season. But isn’t that just another Diwali homework for grownups? Nah, we’re just fine without the readings.

Hence, I wish you a very **happy and fulfilling unwinding time this Diwali**.

*Meaning:*

*Lead me from the unreal to the real,*

*Lead me from darkness to light,*

*Lead me from death to immortality.*
