Did you know that every time we narrate an experience, it changes a little bit? Over the years, the story changes completely.

“So what?” you may ask.

Think about this. You are investing your hard-earned money in a small amount every month.

The moment you decide to invest is a crucial moment.

Two reasons:

1\. You’re telling a story about that investment to yourself.

2\. You won’t remember that story after 6 months. Because it will change with time.

After 6 months, you may mistake your random decision for financial success or vice versa. Due to cognitive biases.

How to circumvent this?

Solution: decision journal.

(Here’s my journal format: )

Every time you make an investment decision, record the story that you’re telling yourself. For example: “I’m purchasing 100 units of this stock as my stock-enthusiast friend recommended it with a 20% appreciation by Q-3 results.”

You can review your decisions when you redeem your investments or while checking the progress.

This is a powerful tool. Not only in the area of investments. But also important life events: such as a job change.

\* Why you’re opting for this new job

\* Which of your problems this new job will solve for you.

In essence, this tool helps you improve your decision-making skills.
