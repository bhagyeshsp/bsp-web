Yes, that’s what we are going to talk about today: PDF editor.

But before that, I hope you kicked off your new year with renewed zeal. As for me, I have already explained [my absurd reason why I have stopped making New Year resolutions](https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/%f0%9f%aa%9c-the-absurd-reason-why-i-stopped-making-new-year-resolutions/).

But one thing is sure, I wanted the first letter of 2024 to be as brief as possible. There are more than 360 days to write at length.

This is where my favorite website comes in handy.

You know sometimes you have to remove a few pages from the pdf, or add some, or make some text edit, or add some shape and colors.

Just minor edits, but you give up.

These features are hard to come by in a free PDF editor.

### That’s why pdfescape.com

Escape from your troubles.

I have been using it for more than 3 years now and it works like a charm.

As soon as you go to [pdfescape.com](http://pdfescape.com), the following screen appears.

I haven’t tried their desktop version, just the browser-supported one.

You don’t need to sign up or anything, just choose Free Online.

Choose whether you want to upload a document or create one and the rest will be taken care of. (Remember, the PDF file has to be <10 MB or less than 100 pages)

I mostly upload the document, I don’t have any need to create a document from scratch.

Once you have opened your PDF file, you will have a sidebar full of tools at your disposal. Most of the features are self-explanatory.

But I want to mention one special feature: encrypting and locking a PDF.

See the Lock icon?

You can hit that icon and select “encrypt” to set a PDF password. This would help you password-protect a PDF file.

Just remember, no amount of password protection is unbreakable, hence use it accordingly. It is good enough for most people, but power users can use different tools to remove password protection.

### What I like about this tool

I like four things about this tool:

- It is free
- It is simple
- It opens in browser-supported
- It doesn’t leave a watermark

That’s it.

Didn’t I tell you I wanted to keep it brief today?

**Try** this tool and **share** your review.

Wait, do you already know a better alternative?

**Hit Reply** and tell me about it!

If you want to learn how to analyze huge chunks of data without complicated tools, read this article by Ben Collins. I’m a big fan of his weekly Google Sheet newsletter. A few weeks back, he sent a survey to all his subscribers. And later shared this behind the scenes in a blog post.

Ben is a seasoned developer, and he is using free AI tools such as ChatGPT for day-to-day tasks. A lot to learn from him.
