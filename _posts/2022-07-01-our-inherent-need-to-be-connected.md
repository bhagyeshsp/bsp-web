Whether we identify ourselves as an introvert or an extrovert, we have this inherent need to be connected with other beings. Not all beings, just the right ones.

In fact, we can see first-hand that we get bored with typical MOOC courses. Because in the end, the best interaction we get is forum-based. There is no real humane exchange.

But, we can see this human-to-human connection and its effects in live cohort-based classes. The tribe is created and then the tribe creates its small pockets.

So why is this important? It is important if youâ€™re managing an organization or building a product. Incorporating this connecting effect by design can do wonders. Of course, you need to gauge its weightage in your context. But more or less, it is important enough to factor into.
