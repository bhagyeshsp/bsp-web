Especially, if you’re narrowly focused on meeting your end goal. The customer, the user the donor sense it. They see through you.

You have to work on what’s there for others. Not a made-up one, a genuine offer.  
Of course, there is never a win-win situation in business or life, but there is always a possibility for a happy bargain.

And when you put that effort, when you try to understand what problems your solution, your product or your organization can solve for the person sitting across you, the sides change. Both parties miraculously sit side-by-side.

Or better, you may not need to convince them at all.  
You may get an enrollment, a partner in growth.
