### Decision Frameworks Overload

I’m tired of hearing about “decision models”, “frameworks”, “matrix” etc etc etc.

“Charlie Munger’s secret. Do this. And boooom!”

It doesn’t work.

Because we’re being lazy.

Mental models and frameworks don’t work on their own.

The practitioner has to practice them.

The way doctors have to “practice” for the rest of their lives.

### Input = Output

Soo, let me set the expectation first:

This method will work, if you work.

This method will work, if you work.

This method will work, if you work.

This method will work, if you work.

This method will work, if you work.

### We’re all decision-makers
