When startup/tech enthusiasts use the term ‘disruptive’, what they mean is a 10X better solution. Refined over a period of a few years.

Earlier, a 10X better solution used to take a couple of decades to develop and refine. Even a millennium.

When we develop a solution keeping ‘disruption’ in mind, we fail by our own standard.

Paper was disruptive technology 3000 years ago, but not anymore.

The goal is not to disrupt, it is to provide a 5X-10X better solution. Disruption will take place of its own accord.
