A year back, I had written about the volatility of our decisions.

I came across an even more [interesting read](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-short-termism-anal-idUSKBN24Z0XZ) sometime back. It showcases how our patience is decreasing. In fact, it is also volatile, with a downward trend.

Look at the attached graph of the shrinking period of US stocks.

In 1990s: 1 year

In 2020: 5-7 months

There are more reasons than just patience behind this decreasing holding period: namely, high short-term gain, machine-enabled trading, and commission-free investments.

In any case, the overall trend showcases the state of our hive mindset.
