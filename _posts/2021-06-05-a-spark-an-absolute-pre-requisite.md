A spark is an absolute prerequisite for an engine to start, but this post is not about a car engine.

We’re talking about engines that drive our life, work and culture.

When we sign up for a course, a degree, a discussion, or an uncomfortable routine, we inherently hope to learn something. Any badge, any piece of certificate is just a symbol. A symbol, a shred of evidence. But they do not guarantee that learning has happened.

To enroll for any of such situations, a list of prerequisite knowledge or skill is required.

As commonly encountered, mere meeting prerequisites is not enough. The problem with such compliance-driven culture is that it makes everything part of compliance.

Learning happens when something creates a spark in the learner’s mind.

No, the spark is not limited to being curious. The spark is an emotional urge to see something happen: something in their own life or someone for whom they’re working.

If a learner is exposed to something that creates a spark in his/her mind that serves his/her best interests or the world’s, the learning is initiated. Yes, initiated. It doesn’t happen. If it happens, it ends. That’s why it is initiated.

It never ends.
