That was the [response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GkyZr9VzPY) from Bob Marley. The interviewer had asked him “have you made a lot of money?”

The question is timeless. Whether we question anyone on their face about their bank balance or not, we ask it in our heads. Constantly.

We need a new question though.

“Do you work hard?” and someday, I hope there will be someone who answers “how much hardwork is enough hardwork?”

We need to define that. Once we define it, we can separate the wheat from the chaff.

And probably, just probably, people may enjoy their lives the way they’re supposed to.
