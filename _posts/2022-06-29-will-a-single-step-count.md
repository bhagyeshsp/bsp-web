I know you have walked the extra mile for someone and so has someone for you. That extra mile would have strengthened your relationship, developed trust and set your intentions in order.

What if someone can only afford to walk an extra step? Not a mile.

See, the thing with doing anything a little bit extra contains a huge level of risk. An investment that we’re unsure of. In such a scenario, setting a very high standard for someone’s gift bars us from checking the possibility of trust.

I used to hold a very high standard of someone’s gift where a step didn’t account for much. It had to be significant. But, that no longer makes sense.

The importance of a single step is as much as a mile.

What is your standard?
