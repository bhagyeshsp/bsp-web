When in 2011, Yuval Noah Harari published his bestseller ‘The Sapiens’, along with many concepts, it reintroduced the importance of gossip in the human social circle. Its primary purpose: survival.

Gossip is an intimate act among a close circle of individuals. It serves as the reservoir of knowledge.

Whatever idea, product or business is worthy of gossip, it spreads. It spreads organically.

Barring the fake news and bad gossip, as creative professionals, we need to ask ourselves, is it worth talking about?

Is it worth making a remark in your absence?

If it is not, do whatever needs to be done.

Then, it will be called ‘word of mouth’.
