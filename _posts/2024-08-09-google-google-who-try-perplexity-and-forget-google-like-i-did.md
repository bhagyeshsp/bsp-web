Did you know that the word Google is based on the word *“Googol”*, a mathematical term for the number one followed by a hundred zeros? Crazy, right?

I remembered all this for most of my adult life.  
​**But I have forgotten about Google’s existence for the last 1 year.**

Because now I have been using perplexity.ai
-------------------------------------------

I don’t want to beat around the bush.  
You can go ahead and try [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) right away!

Don’t forget to sign up, it’s free and will let you save your conversations.

Google’s weaknesses are Perplexity’s strengths
----------------------------------------------

All my complaints about Google’s poor search results have vanished due to perplexity’s real-time surfing and exact answers.  
It is like ChatGPT but better at browsing and referencing.  
Perplexity doesn’t throw a bunch of 20 pages with matching terms, it understands our query and summarizes the references for us.

Plus perplexity also plays the role of ChatGPT
----------------------------------------------

Though I dedicatedly use ChatGPT for AI-aided tasks, perplexity is also excellent at similar tasks.

Google doesn’t come close 2nd
-----------------------------

Perplexity is an excellent research tool. You ask questions, provide documents, receive images, and videos..and everything is hyper-contextual.  
No BS.  
Google just throws a bunch of indexed results at us and we are supposed to make sense of them. It feels like the Stone Age.

So, if you haven’t tried or not using it regularly, pls give it a try and let me know.

In case you have already been using perplexity or anything similar, would you like to share it with me?

**Reads of the week:**

[![](https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/rbtEdYW7FTyuwS4GmN4Fdo)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/beasleydavid/2020/02/20/google-removes-gender-descriptions-on-ai-tool/)

Speaking of Google, one of the reasons Google couldn’t innovate in its category is due to its reverence for certain kind of ideology.

There is something called as **sexual dimorphism** in the animal kingdom. Due to sexual dimorphism, the two sexes look different. AI too, can tell the difference between a man and a woman by looking at the face.

But because “gender is a social construct”, in 2020, Google removed the feature that recognizes men and women differently in their AI tool.

What a waste.

By the way, did you know that this week, a [United States federal court ruled Google to be a monopoly?](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit) Let’s hope Google is forced to disintegrate and begins working on building a better search engine.
