Most of the virtual meets are boring.

Sustained boredom breeds entertainment. This entertainment can lead to insights.

One of the most widely adopted zoom etiquette is to stay on mute until absolutely necessary. When you have a sufficiently large number of group size, this etiquette provides some entertainment with insights.

The invisible dance is among the individuals. It is interesting to note that some individuals engage in discussion with only specific individuals. This behavior is not only limited to engaging in discussions but also being either highly supportive or critical for different people. It is pure pleasure to watch two or more individuals dance in this synchronicity.

One interesting behavior is un-muting followed by an immediate muting. This can be due to many factors, but it provides with insights about the soft-voices that normally do not take part in the discussion.

The insights derived from such behaviors are valuable while designing an online or blended-workshop. The insights help us answer the following questions:

- Who is comfortable with whom?
- Which members need to be tackled skillfully?
- Which members require space and support to speak up?
- Which members are men/women of few words?
- How to formulate balanced sub-group for assignments or other tasks?

The goal is not to make everyone dance, it is to make the dance vibrant.
