Hi Reader,  
How’s your Diwali week progressing?  
I hope you had a good one.  
Wishing you a happy Diwali week.  
Today, I won’t take long. Because I’ve got to be somewhere and you’ve got to relax.  
I hope you began cleaning your PC as per last week’s conversation. It is something that no software can do automatically.

Automatic cleaning today
------------------------

We will use an automatic software for today’s micro-cleaning.  
You just have to select which parts of your PC you want to get cleaned and then press GO.  
It is like chemical wash—as if bleaching. You don’t need to move a muscle and still the cleaning happens.

Micro-cleaning using [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org/download)​
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I have used some other cleaning software most of my life. But this one beats them all.  
It is fully free and open-source (we will talk more about the meaning of open-source and some funny things about how people are abusing this term).  
So, just head over to BleachBit’s [download page](https://www.bleachbit.org/download) and install it on your system. (Yes, it is available for almost all popular Operating Systems)

How to use it?
--------------

### Step-1

Once installed, BleachBit would take a few seconds to scan your PC and understand which different software and browsers you use. So that it can check their temporary files, cache etc.  
My screen looks like this:

By default, the checkboxes would be unchecked.  
A word of caution, Checking “Deep Scan” would reset many of your PC settings, so I recommend not checking it.

### Step-2

Once you have done the checking, you will need to click the first two buttons.  
When you hit “Preview”, it will begin scanning for removal. But will not clean. It will just gather and show you how much space it would be able to free.  
This step would take 5-10 minutes, depending on the junk files on your PC.

### Step-3

Before you hit “Clean”, please make sure that you *really* want to delete your Form History and Passwords from your browser.  
If you save passwords to your browser, please UNCHECK these boxes. There’s no undo button once cleaned.

### Step-4

Now hit “Clean”. The software will take its time cleaning your files.  
At any moment in time, if you want to stop cleaning, hit “Abort”.

### Step-5

Once cleaning is over, you can check the individual cleaning logs. Once satisfied, restart your PC. Restarting will remove any temporary files and repair any broken file paths.

And now your PC is spick-and-span.
