No matter what story you tell yourself about your work, it is always an almost a good idea to go slow. Deliberately.

Unless you’re working on an assembly line, thoughtful action will always outperform an expedited one.

It doesn’t have a philosophical basis, but a mathematical one.

The probability of making mistakes increases with the dilution of attention, practice and the addition of fake urgency.

I mean we can derive a mathematical equation if we want. But, that’s not the point.

Going slow requires planning, intellectual investment and long-term vision.
