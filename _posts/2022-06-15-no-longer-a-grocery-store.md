If you’re selling fruits and vegetables in a thriving city market, you will hear and see your customers directly.

This is not true for most businesses though. The people you seek to serve are not in physical proximity.

But we have to keep our eyes and ears open. Physical distance is no excuse for not listening to them.

With modern businesses, our physical senses get replaced by several hundred other proxy senses in form of data:

- Did the customer click on the button?
- Did the customer raise a ticket?
- Did the issue get resolved on time?
- Did the customer make another purchase?
- Did the customer refer to anyone?
- Did the customer give up on our product?
- Did the student understand the concept?
- Did the student apply the concept?
- Did the student earn the grades that he wanted to?
- Did the yoga student continue the yoga exercises after leaving camp?
- Did the yoga student inspire any of her family members?

And these were binary questions. Yes or No.

Our senses become high resolution with more why, what, how, when, and which questions.

For example, add WHY to the questions.

- Why did the customer click on the button?
- Why did the customer raise a ticket?
- Why did the issue get resolved on time?
- Why did the customer make another purchase?
- Why did the customer refer to someone?
- Why did the customer give up on our product?
- Why did the student understand the concept?
- Why did the student apply the concept?
- Why did the student earn the grades that he wanted to?
- Why did the yoga student continue the yoga exercises after leaving camp?
- Why did the yoga student inspire some of her family members?

These are important questions.

Our customers want to be heard and seen.

It is easier than ever to make them feel heard and seen.

But, first, we have to put in the work.

We have to set systems that act as supernatural senses. Senses that are attuned to our customers’ inner conflicts.
