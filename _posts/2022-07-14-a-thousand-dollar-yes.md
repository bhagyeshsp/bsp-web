It is a disservice to the client to say YES. For their every whim and wants.

A client may come up with impromptu plans for a design change, a marketing tactic or the school administration comes up with a new student competition idea.

As a designer, a marketer or a school principal, your one YES can cost a thousand dollars. Not to you, but to your client. To your organization.

When we say YES, we need to think about how much it costs in money. Almost all resources can be converted into their equivalent money value. Give it a dollar value and see how much damage we cause on a regular basis.

“But it’s not that easy to say NO”, you may shrug off.

And that’s a choice you’re making.

A little bit of conflict is better than heavy cost.
