“Customer is the god.”  
“Whatever you do, never lose money.”  
And there are more monotheistic ideas. They’re popular.  
It is a commonly observed trait that the ideas that preach power, seem to gain traction. But that’s just for popular media and op-eds.

The reality is more convoluted.

There are stakeholders. More than one. And that makes the monotheistic ideas lose their ground.

For example, Apple and Amazon are aggressively customer-centric. We enjoy the products and services when we are at the receiving end of their relentless pursuit of customer satisfaction. But, what if we were to be hired to assemble an iPhone or work at an FBA warehouse? Our experience will change.

So, what is the alternative?  
The indoctrination of the present generation with the seeds of monotheistic ideas in business needs to be replaced with something more sustainable and more humane than the current ‘growth at any cost mindset’.

There is more than one god when it comes to running a business and all of them require their own deserving weightage.

When we launch our next manifesto for our organization, we need to be cautious about what kind of philosophy we’re preaching.

Faith in one idea comes with a conflict with the other ideas.  
Eventually, someone has to pay the price.
