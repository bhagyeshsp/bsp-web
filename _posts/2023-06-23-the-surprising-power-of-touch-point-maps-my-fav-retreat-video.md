So dear reader, I received voting from most of the readers on the Reads of the Week last week. Thank you so much for voting to keep the long-read suggestions on. I will keep sharing the long articles in that section. Thank you so much for voicing your opinion.

Last week, we discussed [why you should not shy away from considering yourself a designer](https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/like-most-people-do-you-also-think-youre-not-a-designer/). In the span of a week, you’d have reflected on that idea. And if you’re still on the fence about it, today’s letter would bridge the gap in my communication.

Today, I want to share a technique with you that most design firms use. Mind well, it is not a secret. But it is widely accepted that unless you have a thriving design studio, you shouldn’t bother using this technique.

How stupid!

### The technique

It is called Touchpoint Mapping. During the process of design, it is used: whether it is software, a mobile app, a campaign, or a workshop!

The idea is to identify every touchpoint that your customer or a user comes in direct contact with. After identification, each touchpoint is discussed in detail for the planning and further design.

Look at this basic framework.
