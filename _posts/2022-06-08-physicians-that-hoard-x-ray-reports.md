Have you heard of such a physician? Me neither. Because the physician knows the importance of analyzing the X-ray report and prescribing medicine.

When it comes to data, most organizations suffer from two ailments:

- Lack of data
- Lack of dissemination of data due to data hoarding

Data, like grains, is a commodity. Whoever controls the supply, controls the bargain.

Unlike physical commodities, data is not finite. The more relevant stakeholders have it, the more valuable it can be. Not less.

It is natural to get attached to something that may give us pride or a sense of value. But we are not a mathematical Zero which requires a prefix.
