Is AI going to replace all of us? No, I donâ€™t think so.  
Is AI going to equip all of us? Yes, If we ask for help.

In this walkthrough, you can see the usage of AI in creating Atal Tinkering Lab sessions. This could be anything: a science class, history class, or career counselling session. Anything. You get the idea.

The main objective is to see whether your institution or organization thinking and designing to make the work more fun, more involving and providing a window to the people to look at the horizons.

In this case, the ATL AI Assistant helps the educator break from the rut. Same curriculum, and the same sessions. No more.

What similar challenges come to your mind? A challenge where your hunch says that AI can be helpful somehow.
