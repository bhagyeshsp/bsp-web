Technology is not here to replace us. (Read Rule no.3 in my New World Rules [here](https://bhagyeshpathak.com/new-world-rules/))

It is here to liberate us.

Liberate our time.

Liberate our mind space.

Why to liberate us?

That’s a million-dollar question.

\*Liberate us to fill with entertainment?

\*Liberate us to fill with 10-second TikTok?

\*Liberate us to fill with early evening Booze weekends?

\*Liberate us to fill with junk work?

\*Liberate us for working lunch?

The impact of technology on our lives is still new. We’re learning.

If we’re learning, can we set our intention to use the empty time and space to fill ourselves with:

\*More time for self

\*More time for our relationships

\*More time for artistic expression

\*More time for soul-searching

\*More time for anything that increases our capacity to love

The choice is ours.

Every time.
