All of us feel lost at some point in our lives and career.

“Why did I choose this work?”

“Why did I choose this partner?”

“Why did I choose this product rollout strategy?”

And so on…

One thing that works for me is noting my WHY early on. Writing on a paper. Seems a bit weird and nerdy. Because it is. The thing is, our mental states change with time and so does the story that we tell ourselves. It helps to ground ourselves if we can recollect what our reasons were.

This practice is similar to a decision journal. Check it out [here](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/decision-journal_draft3.pdf).

And yes, I keep a decision journal too! Once you see the power of this practice, you can’t help it.
