I love using software products. They make life so easy.

Normally, my software exploration goes like this:

\*I come across a situation. Mostly problems.

\*I know the manual way is lengthy. That’s the last option.

\*I explore the internet. Deep dive.

And..mostly I get what I look for.

I’m convinced of one truth: you need to solve the problem in your mind before you do it using a software.

I don’t mean to calculate 19999923/93456 in the mind.

I’m talking about the macro steps. The approach. That is what we need to have figured out.

Software is just a tool. Allowing us to automate.

The next time your organization is deciding to run some sort of new software training, be vigilante of the participants. Some people are more adept than others. It helps in formulating training groups.
