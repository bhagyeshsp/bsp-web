    <p><em>‚ÄúHe is a bright guy, but seems like he is in his comfort zone.‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúShe is great, but as soon as you ask her to step out and talk to the customer, she loses her shine.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Reader, haven‚Äôt all of us either overheard or participated in similar conversations? In fact, for many of us, it is a part of work. As in, we have to know what makes people tick. And if it is a bad fit, we have to <a href="bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/capacity-to-give-up-on-people">give up on people</a>.</p>

<p>One of the keys to facilitating team members is understanding what makes them tick and exposing them to those things.</p>

<p>Sloooowly.</p>

<p>Not by shocking them! (On a side note, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqobbcK0R-o">this is how</a> the ice bucket challenge started.)</p>

<p>And still, we regularly put our team members in such untenable situations, because we think that we are helping them <em>‚Äúget out of their comfort zone‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/cfTvj673AY6CP8oWwxwUwt" alt="" /></p>

<p>The problem is that our understanding of our comfort zone is incomplete.</p>

<h3 id="either-youre-out-or-youre-in">Either you‚Äôre OUT or you‚Äôre IN</h3>

<p>We are led to believe that there are only two zones: outside comfort zone and inside comfort zone</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/bnvbfyNktfStR6eiCZh71c" alt="" /></p>

<p>And makes us push people. Burn them mentally. Or sometimes, give them a false sense of accomplishment.</p>

<h3 id="there-are-at-least-4-zones">There are at least 4 zones</h3>

<p>Comfort, Groan, Growth, and Panic These are self-explanatory zones and you can stop reading beyond this. But if you‚Äôre still reading this, thank you.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/faaoJWqThtn3xZ6cwmKHqn" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Comfort zone:</strong> our old self lives in this zone and we maintain our old patterns</p>

<p><strong>Groan zone:</strong> there‚Äôs a little familiarity, a little bit of anxiety, feels risky and we want to fall back to the comfort zone</p>

<p><strong>Growth zone:</strong> feeling confident, experiencing the integration of past knowledge with fresh knowledge, sense of fulfillment, peak performance</p>

<p><strong>Panic zone:</strong> fight, flight or freeze, learning stops</p>

<h3 id="so-what">So what?</h3>

<p>Okay, so what‚Äôs the big deal? Now we can talk in terms of 4 zones. But it is not that simple.</p>

<p>We have to train ourselves to understand what makes people tick and what their incremental learning phases are. Also, we have the additional burden of keeping our <a href="bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/the-seductive-urge-to-manage-people">seductive urge to manage people</a> in check.</p>

<h3 id="we-have-a-choice-to-make">We have a choice to make</h3>

<p>A choice to look at people around us in a binary of 0 and 1.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>A choice to look at people more humanely.</p>

<p>So, as soon as we embrace the 4 zones, we can‚Äôt say: ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pushing her out of her comfort zone‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just not ready to go out of his comfort zone‚Äù</p>

<p>Because what do we mean by ‚Äúout of comfort zone‚Äù? Groan? Growth? or Panic?</p>

<p>See? There‚Äôs a nuance to people‚Äôs comfort zones.</p>

<p><strong>For example</strong>, you have a team member named Suresh. You noticed that when you ask Suresh to visit customers in their office and talk to them, he cannot make the sale. His performance becomes average.</p>

<p>But on the telephone, he can sell anything to anyone.</p>

<p>By pushing Suresh for in-person meetings, you may mistake thinking that you‚Äôre helping him. But you might be directly pushing him into the ‚Äúpanic‚Äù zone.</p>

<p>It would be more beneficial to scaffold Suresh‚Äôs journey by: ‚Äì Introducing the customer over a call ‚Äì Sending Suresh with other sales staff to acclimatize on sales calls ‚Äì Inviting the customer to meet Suresh at the office</p>

<p>There are such 100s of possible ways to gently and incrementally push Suresh. In a way that is helpful to him.</p>

<p>So, that‚Äôs how changing the way we look at things, indeed changes things. In this case, people.</p>

<p>Almost 2000 years back in Italy, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius destroyed and permanently preserved the city of Pompeii.</p>

<p>It also preserved a library with thousands of scrolls in it. But we couldn‚Äôt open or read them. They‚Äôre charred and fried by the lava. But no more.</p>

<p>Thanks to GitHub ex-CEO Nat Friedman, his Vesuvius Challenge has begun revealing the contents of the scrolls using AI and 3D modeling.</p>
