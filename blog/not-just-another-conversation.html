  <div class="post-content">
    <p>In my previous piece, I talked about why I stopped presenting and started conversing.</p>

<p>But what kind of conversation?</p>

<p>Chit-chat?</p>

<p>Small talk?</p>

<p>Philosophical drag?</p>

<p>NO.</p>

<p>A diagnostic one. Unassuming. Bias-free conversation.</p>

<p>A good medical practitioner doesn’t cut open a patient based on his instinct. Instead, the first step is talking to the patient. Understanding his problem. Corroborating his judgement with supporting evidence. And ultimately deciding the best approach forward.</p>

<p>This is why we have to hold a conversation BEFORE we start designing a solution.</p>

<p>So, how to hold an effective conversation? In my experience, these are good points to keep in mind:</p>

<p>(1) It’s not about you: getting out of the equation should be the first step while holding a conversation. We are not there to assert our credentials and past knowledge. Every challenge is unique.</p>

<p>(2) “Can you tell me more about it?”: this almost always works. You will be surprised by finding how much more people are willing to share when you ask this. You understand their challenges better. It is not a trick question. It shows your genuine interest.</p>

<p>(3) Crazy focus on the process: the devil lies in the details of the process. Most of the problems have roots somewhere in the chain of process. The conversation is a tool to reach that tool.</p>

<p>(4) “What’s your vision?”: an effective solution is useless if it doesn’t align with the vision. A wholesome conversation helps us translate the organization’s vision in our head, as it is.</p>

<p>(5) Past failures: oftentimes, you may be not the first person to be onboarded to solve the challenge. It is always a good idea to ask about the past mistakes of different people. What they missed out on. Reinventing a wheel is in no one’s interest.</p>

<p>If you carefully go through these pointers, you will realize none of these is practised during a presentation. Presentations are by-default, just presentations.</p>

<p>The dominant corporate culture has failed to educate. Too much glamour and too little education lead to practices that are out of touch with reality.</p>

<p>Conversations are here to stay. They’re in there for a long haul. And that PowerPoint we had made a year back? Well, whose life was changed by it?</p>
