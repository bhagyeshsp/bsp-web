    <p>Reader, if it was a matter of life and death to win a Formula-1 race, which car would you choose?</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/cWdhtXfazWotzaLk8ZNdd4?ar=1%3A1&amp;fit=crop" alt="" /><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/5sPSajbKXdyx48aE36uYbL?ar=1%3A1&amp;fit=crop" alt="" /></p>

<p>Okay, what about choosing a gift for King Charles III if you were to pay him a visit?</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/myYeC1sGExLGbAmFobowk6?ar=1%3A1&amp;fit=crop" alt="" /><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/uMJojm5papbLk5MubtfvU1?ar=1%3A1&amp;fit=crop" alt="" /></p>

<p>Both of us know each other‚Äôs choices. And the choices are the same.</p>

<p>But why?</p>

<p>Why would we end up selecting a regular F1 car for the race and this gorgeous faucet for a gift?</p>

<h3 id="because-we-know-the-functions"><strong>Because we know the functions</strong></h3>

<p>F1 car to win the race.</p>

<p>Faucet to show our artistic taste to his highness.</p>

<p>We know that the artistic-looking F1 car is not going to win us race. It is more of a showpiece. And we know King Charles is not looking for a faucet to wash his hands. It is merely a collectible. With a high degree of royal, artistic look.</p>

<h3 id="form-follows-function">Form Follows Function</h3>

<p>‚ÄúForm follows function‚Äù is a design principle that suggests the shape or design of an object should primarily be based on its <strong>intended function</strong> or <strong>purpose</strong>.</p>

<p>When an object‚Äôs form doesn‚Äôt follow its function, people quickly notice it. Because bad design is loud.</p>

<h3 id="why-dont-we-use-this-principle">Why don‚Äôt we use this principle?</h3>

<p>If you remember, a few months back we had discussed in a letter that the problem lies in <a href="https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/like-most-people-do-you-also-think-youre-not-a-designer/">not considering ourselves a designer</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/cSFjwh76PjvNEJS8ngCCLh" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-13 182215.png" /></p>

<p>If your work includes writing emails, WhatsApp messages, or managing a project, you are a designer. Not philosophically, practically. And it has real-life implications: on your work, your income, your status, and your satisfaction.</p>

<h3 id="but-waiit-how-to-use-this-principle-in-my-work"><em>‚ÄúBut waiit. How to use this principle in my work?‚Äù</em></h3>

<p>Fair question.</p>

<p>I have been just rambling about ‚Äúform follows function‚Äù until now.</p>

<p><strong>But before that‚Ä¶a rant-cum-example üòÑ</strong></p>

<p>Have you noticed your HR department sending some important announcements?</p>

<p>They use at least <strong>three communication channels</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mass Email</li>
  <li>WhatsApp Group</li>
  <li>Written Memo on paper</li>
  <li>Notice Board <em>(this is bonus)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The funny thing is, that they copy-paste the same content for all communication channels. No modification.</p>

<p>The function of each communication channel is different. This begs for modification of the content form.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mass email‚Äôs function is to convey generic, non-urgent, lengthy, formal communication</li>
  <li>WhatsApp group‚Äôs function is to convey generic, urgent, concise, informal communication</li>
  <li>Paper memo‚Äôs function is to convey specific, non-urgent, business, compliance-worthy communication</li>
  <li>The notice board‚Äôs function is to advertise generic, non-urgent, public communications</li>
</ol>

<p>Don‚Äôt tell me you haven‚Äôt observed this. It is impossible to miss!</p>

<h3 id="so-how-to-use-it-in-our-work">So, how to use it in our work</h3>

<p><strong>Document Formatting</strong></p>

<p>For example, in last week‚Äôs letter, we talked about <a href="https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/%f0%9f%aa%9c-google-docs-ms-words-simplicity-the-most-ignored-feature/">using text styles to format content</a>. Or if you remember, we had covered the concept of <a href="https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/tfn16-%f0%9f%aa%9c-negative-space-white-spacewhat-is-it/">negative space/white space</a> a few weeks back.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/eWqLBEhMjSY8VnvDqU4oxE" alt="3.png" />‚Äã<a href="https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/tfn16-%f0%9f%aa%9c-negative-space-white-spacewhat-is-it/">Example of introducing white space from that letter</a>‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Email inbox/Files Organization</strong></p>

<p>Use appropriate tags, colors, and folder structure to keep your email inbox or filing cabinet clutter-free.</p>

<p><strong>File Naming and Version Control</strong></p>

<p>For example, files and folders could be named with the project name, date, and version number, in a particular sequence. This ensures that team members can quickly locate the most recent or relevant version.</p>

<p><strong>Task and Project Management Tools</strong></p>

<p>‚ÄúDoes it make sense to my organization/team with 30 people to use a software that Google with 100,000 staff uses?‚Äù ‚Äî I wish more and more organizations asked this question to themselves before jumping on any trendy project management tools.</p>

<p><strong>Data Visualization</strong></p>

<p>There is a big difference between using a pie chart and using a bar chart. Even if the data is the same. Because the form matters. Refer to this article on <a href="https://visme.co/blog/types-of-graphs/">44 types of charts and their usage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Meetings</strong></p>

<p>The purpose must decide a meeting‚Äôs form.</p>

<p>Online, offline, scheduled, impromptu, one-on-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, short, long‚Ä¶..and you got the idea.</p>

<p>And if you think about it, I could have just used a handwritten letter to communicate this. But it wouldn‚Äôt fulfill its purpose.</p>

<p>So, have you knowingly or unknowingly applied this principle in your work?</p>

<p>What about comic situations where people simply ignore the principle?</p>

<p><strong>Hit Reply</strong> and tell me.</p>

<p><strong>Reads of the week:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://37signals.com/group-chat-problems"><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/up477N38TzgmuNsSgeBQef" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Group chat = group stress.</p>

<p>The mass communication rant in this letter reminded me of this classic article by 37Signal‚Äôs team.</p>

<p>If you still operate your work on group chat, think again.</p>

<p>Imagine. In the early 70s, schools recruited staff to keep a watch on high schoolers‚Äô mathematics homework notes. To double check if the calculations were manual or using a calculator. If you remember, we touched on this <em>non-issue</em> a few weeks back in <a href="https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/tfn12-%f0%9f%9f%a6-5-things-photoshops-firefly-update-tells-us-even-if-we-dont-use-it/">5 things Photoshop‚Äôs Firefly update tells us, even if we don‚Äôt use it</a>. AI is here. We invented it and there is no going back. That‚Äôs also a part of my <a href="https://bhagyeshpathak.com/new-world-rules/">new world rules</a>.</p>
