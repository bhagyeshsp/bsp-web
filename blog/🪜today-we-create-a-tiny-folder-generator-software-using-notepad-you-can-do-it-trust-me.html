    <p>Trust me, it is worth spending 5 minutes of your life.<br />
All you need is Notepad on a Windows PC and NO programming knowledge.<br />
You may wonder, why we would go to the length of creating our folder-generator when we can create as many as we want using a mouse click.<br />
I’d tell you this:</p>

<p>1. Because it is fun<br />
2. We can create 1000s of folders in a single click, as many times as we want.<br />
But, first, this is how it all started:</p>

<h3 id="in-2020-i-needed-to-create-multiple-folders">In 2020, I needed to create multiple folders</h3>

<p>Not once, but multiple times and many of them were nested. So, it was cumbersome to do it manually.<br />
Every time, I had to copy-paste the past folder structure with files and manually delete them to have a fresh folder structure for my use.</p>

<p>That’s when I came across this solution on the internet.<br />
We will take an example for easy understanding.</p>

<h3 id="lets-say-you-want-to-create-expense-report-folders">Let’s say you want to create expense report folders</h3>

<p>For example, you want to manage the monthly expense reports received from your team into relevant folders.<br />
Your team comprises four people: Anil, Rashi, Shubham, and Divesh.</p>

<p>You will need a folder structure that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/qy3rmes5buwaMDYNb4PWSX" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="you-can-create-these-folders-easily-using-notepad">You can create these folders easily using Notepad</h3>

<p>For our tutorial, I will show you how to do it for three months of folders. That will create 17 nested folders as many times as we want.</p>

<p>Step-1</p>

<p>Open Notepad on your computer<br />
​</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/osaV5c5dTAPjLidfFAri9e" alt="1 27.png" /></p>

<p>Step-2</p>

<p>Now write the folder structure you want to create. We will tell the computer to Make Directory (i.e. create a folder) using the word: MD.</p>

<p>So every new folder will go like this. Compare it with the folder structure shared at the beginning.<br />
You can see that the parent folder is 2024. It has three child folders: Jan, Feb and Mar. Each child folders have its own child folder named after the team members.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/fcsu2LxwCRJoj3x6hcxznn" alt="2 27.png" /></p>

<p>Step-3</p>

<p>We are almost done. Now hit “Save”. You will need to give this file a name and add a “.bat” extension. I named it “ExpenseFolderGenerator.bat”.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/iuvHeH7Pn4gEgph7ej7uMx" alt="3 28.png" /></p>

<p>Step-4</p>

<p>Your folder generator is ready.<br />
Wherever you want to create these folders, paste this BAT file and hit double-click!<br />
As soon as you double-click it, the Command Prompt will ask you to press any key on the keyboard to grant permission.<br />
Just press any key and your folders will be created instantly!</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/h4QYPtDuy5b5ADb4jQPUvN" alt="4 20.png" /></p>

<p>And now you have a working software program to make your folders as many times as you want.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-modify-and-distribute-it">How to modify and distribute it?</h3>

<p>You may want to modify the BAT file. You can open it in Notepad and make the edits as you find fit. You can create multiple copies of this file and distribute it to anyone.</p>

<h3 id="theres-no-limit">There’s no limit</h3>

<p>There’s no limit to how many folders you can create with this method. Just make sure that whenever your folder name has space in it, the name should be enclosed in double quotations.</p>

<p>So, 2024/Jan/”Anil Kumar” will go like this.</p>

<h3 id="how-about-1000-folders">How about 1000 folders?</h3>

<p>Now, if you’re wondering how to do this for 1000 folders, let me know and I will show you how I do it fast. Same method, same Notepad, but just a slight difference.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to write to me when you try this!<br />

This is one of those taboo topics that Jessica kind of pointed out in her article The Sound of Silence, that the culture doesn’t want us to discuss. It is like that scene in the Chernobyl series where no matter what the underlying mathematics, the State — the Ideology — is supreme. And it is the ultimate truth. Which results in mass delusion.</p>

<p>The said article tries to defile its sharp edges, but several empirical studies confirm what is said in the title. People find it counter-intuitive and the resulting cognitive dissonance makes them change the subject altogether.</p>
