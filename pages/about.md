10 years ago, I received an offer I couldn’t refuse.

How could have I turned down the chance to embark on an incredible journey? It was aboard a state-of-the-art train, covering 17,000 km, and traversing every Indian state non-stop for 7 months. This experience not only introduced me to the world of work but also transformed my outlook on life. It was vibrant, challenging, and youthful, in short — enchanting.

Over the past decade, I’ve primarily collaborated with founders of various organizations, predominantly small to medium-sized ones, helping bring their visions to life.

As my capacity allows me to take on only a limited number of assignments each year, I’m excited about the prospect of working with an exceptional group of individuals in the next decade.

Frequently, people ask me about the types of assignments I can assist with. While I can certainly provide a list of my past projects, there’s no guarantee that my next assignment will mirror my previous ones.

For instance, I’ve:

- Implemented systems for data collection, analysis, and monitoring for a dynamic organization.  
- Set up a marketing funnel and email dispatch system for a U.S.-based startup.  
- Created compelling scripts and teaching aids for unique educational concepts.  
- Established an in-house monitoring system for 10,000 students and over 100 schools.  
- Revitalized a decade-old scholarship system for improved efficiency and transparency.  
- Shaped a curriculum that was adopted by the Delhi Government.  
- Orchestrated multiple data collection and analysis exercises.  
- Developed an innovative human development-centric impact assessment program for residential training, a one-of-its-kind initiative.  
- Played a pivotal role in designing a mobile tools workshop to expand outreach in rural areas.  
- Collaborated on the development and delivery of STEM curriculum, kits, and sessions.  
- Contributed to R&D efforts to enhance content for tablet-based learning.  
- Embarked on a 7-month journey promoting STEM education in a unique train-based initiative.

So, what’s on your mind?

Please don’t think that your project is mundane or boring.

I have a knack for turning boring things into interesting.  
That’s my work.

See you!
