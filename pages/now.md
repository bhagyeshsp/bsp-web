Updated on March 28th, 2025 from my desk

Right now I'm residing in Ahmedabad. March-June months are typically quite hot here. And they're getting hotter (until early 2000s the media and "experts" were saying it is due to some Ozone layer hole. Then they started saying that it is due to Global Warming. Now I'm convinced it is due to Climate Change). Let's see how this season goes.

## Watching, reading...
I'm not binging any web series at the moment. And reading is a continuous process. Right now in the middle of "Seven years in Tibet". Looks like I'm going to leave this read reserved for travel. I found it more enjoying while traveling.

## Working...
There are couple of things I'm working on:
- Catering to a few clients on their tech solutions.
- Creating professional-grade physical copies of the [Wu Wei Cards]({{'/shop##if-youre-in-the-business-of-facilitation' | relative_url}}). I'm quite excited about putting them in the market.
- Creating a simple Meal Planner app. We have been using a pen-and-paper meal planner at my home for more than 6 months. It is time to create an app. The app is almost ready. I tried to over-engineer it for offline capabilities and it was soo difficult that I abandoned the idea. Now improving the online-only version.
- Coming up: a web template marketplace. [I recently published an open-source Jekyll template](https://github.com/bhagyeshsp/jekyll-objectivist-theme). This upcoming marketplace will have such templates: some free and some premium.

## Travel plans...
No immediate leisure travel plans. Maybe a trip in and around Pune in couple of weeks, for work. And that's not travel.

## Writing...
I'm working on an essay about Artificial Intelligence. [I published one]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-08-06-to-ai-or-not-to-ai %}) a few months ago on the same subject. Experiencing the effects of AI first-hand, I won't be surprised if I wrote a couple more essays on the subject.
