    <h1>Extremely Disorganized Reading List</h1>


    <div style="text-align: center;"> <!-- Added a div to center the image -->
        <img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 300px;" src="/assets/images/books/bookshelf_by_scrawlednotions.webp"
            alt="Bhagyesh's Bookshelf by Scrawlednotions">
        <p style="font-size: small;">My bookshelf illustrated by <a href="https://hardishukla.com">Hardi Shukla</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>The world is already tainted with univariate identity groups. And I donâ€™t believe in such things. So, this is an
        intentionally disorganized list. I have provided each book with 3-4 tags to help you get the overall theme.
        Happy reading!
