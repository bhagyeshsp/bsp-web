The world is in the first phase of transition from an industrial age to a technological one. The people who adapt to the new world rules will thrive, while others will struggle.

### Deep workers are going to become scarce.
With the shortening attention span and culture attributing more social value to the ability to multi-task, people capable of focusing and working on a specific assignment for a sustained period of time will continue to decline. This coincides with the time when more and more deep workers are required to solve problems.

### Every worldly interaction is UX.
The ones who understand this, will thrive.

### Fear of getting replaced by the technology will indeed replace the ones who harbor that fear.
Fear blurs reality. No matter how much scary the imaginary fear might be, technology is here to stay and grow to provide leverage to the individuals who are open to change. The ones who take technology on their side, will thrive. And the others ones, they will be replaced.

### Facilitation is core to well-being.
In a world full of flawed humans, with almost everyone having survived some degree of trauma, having the capacity to walk in their shoes and facilitating to look past their worldview towards a better world is an emotional slog. More the sloggers, the better. Such facilitation capacity makes the individual indispensable.

### Healthy body, healthy mind.
The continuous rise in consumption of processed food, recreational drugs, pills culture and lack of quality sleep will provide a competitive advantage to those who rate comparatively better on these aspects. A less damaged body hosts a less damaged mind.

### Race to serve, not to be served.
Amid the race to be served, the ones who innately recognize the value of serving others and genuinely commit themselves to act upon their belief will be rewarded. In fact, it ceases to be a race. It becomes harmony.

### A manager-less world.
For self-managing units to exist, self-managing individuals are required. The ones who care enough to figure out what is the vision, what is the goal or where we are making a mistake, will be rewarded for increasing the efficiency, identifying the problem at its root in a manager-less world. That world is real because the work is not on an assembly line. Not anymore.

### Emotional labor is the secret ingredient.
The knowledge engine getting more and more open, technical skills and qualifications are going to be widespread. Individuals with a willingness to exert emotional labor, individuals who genuinely care holds the competitive advantage.

### Not network, a connection. One at a time.
The internet has made it incredibly easy for any two individuals to get in touch and network. The ability to add bulk people in a short period of time has a significantly low ROI. Connections forged over a substantial period of time, anchored by trust, vulnerability and shared vision are to stay. This network effect is the greatest of all.

### Intellectual outsourcing is not a strength.
Outsourcing everything to a computer program is not a strength. The ability to integrate ideas, synthesize models and weigh the possible outcomes in a mind, is a rare ability. Individuals who hone these abilities, will be in a position to make the greatest impact in their area of influence.

*The New World Rules are not new. Until now, individuals stood a good chance of thriving or making a moderate living by ignoring the core philosophy behind these ideas. Not anymore.

*This list is dynamic, I sincerely wish that an equilibrium is reached someday and I don’t need to update it. (Now, that’s wishful thinking!)

*The New World Rules are inspired by Kevin Kelly’s [New Rules](https://kk.org/newrules/). Thank you Kevin.
