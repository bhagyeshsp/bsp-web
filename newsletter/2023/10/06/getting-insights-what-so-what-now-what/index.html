    <p>Reader, did you know that you can derive pretty good insights from any data using just <strong>three questions</strong>:</p>

<p><em>What?</em></p>

<p><em>So what?</em></p>

<p><em>Now what?</em></p>

<p>Data can be anything.</p>

<p>A fact.</p>

<p>A conversation.</p>

<p>An incident.</p>

<p>A story</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>A database!</p>

<p>Data doesnâ€™t have to always look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/5Qr9HDa8Lw46QCqCTwPtQM" alt="1407938242wordpress-database.png" /></p>

<p>Data means information.</p>

<p>Whenever we want to learn from the information, we have to process it.</p>

<p>There is a processing funnel.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/dzqhaDy8ngW3oCYYEnz5bn" alt="Untitled" /></p>

<p>The data passes through <strong>three stages</strong> in the funnel:</p>

<h3 id="1-what">1. What?</h3>

<p>This is a reflection stage.</p>

<p>We identify key information and connect it with other information.</p>

<p>It is important to know what is it that we are interested in processing. We canâ€™t process all the information at once.</p>

<p>Also, we identify the impact.</p>

<h3 id="2-so-what">2. So what?</h3>

<p>Once we have narrowed down and identified the impact of the information, we reach this stage.</p>

<p>Here, we sum up what we have learned.</p>

<p>We also look for applications of what we have learned.</p>

<h3 id="3-now-what">3. Now what?</h3>

<p>Just knowing our learnings is not enough.</p>

<p>We have to commit to action.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s where this last question comes in handy.</p>

<p>Now what do we want to do?</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Let me illustrate this processing technique using an example.</p>

<p>If you remember, in my <a href="https://get.bhagyeshpathak.com/datasystem">Data System Design Handbook</a>, I have used an example of 10,000 tablets distributed to schools.</p>

<p>Suppose, during the annual review, we learned that 10% of the tablets were vandalized in a few schools by notorious students.</p>

<p>This is how we can process this data:</p>

<p><strong>What? (The review stage)</strong></p>

<p>What exactly happened?</p>

<p>Which schools have the highest number of vandalized tablets?</p>

<p><strong>So what? (Sum up, apply)</strong></p>

<p>How can we prevent this from re-occurring in the future?</p>

<p>Is there anything peculiar about those schools?</p>

<p>What is the cost of damage?</p>

<p><strong>Now what? (Action)</strong></p>

<p>Who is going to get in touch with those schools?</p>

<p>What message will we be relaying to the affected schools?</p>

<p>How will we recover the damage?</p>

<p>So, those are the questions that I ask myself when trying to get insights from any data.</p>

<p>What about you?</p>

<p><strong>Hit Reply</strong> and tell me.</p>

<p>Also, if you want me to cover specific topics, <strong>write back to me</strong>.</p>

<p>If you think AI applications such as ChatGPT are just question-answer machines, these prompts from Microsoft will stun you. They released fantastic prompts to use with GPT models such as ChatGPT for educators and students. I tried a few of them, and I was in awe!</p>

<p>Especially, if you have <strong>kids</strong> or <strong>students</strong>, ask them to use them.</p>
