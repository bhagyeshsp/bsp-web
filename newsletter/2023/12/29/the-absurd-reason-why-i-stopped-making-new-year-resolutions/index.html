    <p>Before I dive into explanations, wishing you a blockbuster <strong>New Year!</strong></p>

<p>I hope you get to fulfill your promises and resolutions by the end of 2024.</p>

<p>And that allows me to share <em>my reason</em> â€• which you will find absurd. My reason behind ditching the whole New Year resolution thing. If youâ€™re making resolutions, by all means, please continue doing so. Didnâ€™t I just tag my reason as absurd?</p>

<p>A year is a convenient way to know that our Earth has completed one revolution around the Sun. 1 revolution = 1 year.</p>

<p>So, our Earth moves at a relative velocity of ~1,00,000 km/hr !!</p>

<p>And as we know, the Sun is not static. It is also moving. Approximately relative velocity of ~70,000 km/hr. It takes the Sun 225 million years to make one revolution around the center of the Milky Way. (I would call it an actual New Year. But then, I wouldnâ€™t be there.)</p>

<p>This means we are on a long journey where it will take 225 million years to return to the same spot in space.</p>

<p>In short, we are doomed. I would rather enjoy the 1,00,000 km/hr bumpy ride than pressurize myself with abstract, unreachable, eccentric wishlists that I have to complete under 1 revolution.</p>

<p>I hope you understand this is not the real reason. Because I donâ€™t have any solid reason, not to have new year resolutionsðŸ˜„ It is just too difficult to follow through.</p>

<p><strong>Cheers to 2024!</strong></p>

<p>See you next year.</p>
