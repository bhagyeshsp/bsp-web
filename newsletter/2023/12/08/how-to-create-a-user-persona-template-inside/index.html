    <p>The other day, my friend told me about the latest online scam tactic. In this tactic, the scammer poses as a police/CBI/Narcotics official and grills their victim for hours. Eventually, their victim pays some heavy amount of money and gets scammed.</p>

<p>But this one never gets old:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/8oJUW1P7Ry6wpx51MxRedR" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thatâ€™s one of the famous versions of the <strong>Nigerian Prince Scam</strong>.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re anything like me, and read all the versions of the Nigerian Prince Scam, you will laugh until your cheeks hurt.</p>

<p>I mean why would people believe in such types of emails?</p>

<p>They shouldnâ€™t. But still, thousands of people believe such emails/calls every day.</p>

<p>But why not you or me?</p>

<h3 id="are-we-special">Are we special?</h3>

<p>If you laughed after reading the Nigerian princeâ€™s email, we know something for sure:</p>

<p>Youâ€™re not the scammerâ€™s ideal audience (<em>victim</em>).</p>

<p>Because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Youâ€™re not foolish to believe in such emails</li>
  <li>You know online scams are real</li>
  <li>Youâ€™re digitally literate</li>
  <li>You noticed something fishy</li>
  <li>You noticed that the email has a couple of typos</li>
  <li>Youâ€™re not greedy</li>
  <li>You donâ€™t believe in get-rich-quick schemes</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/tdMkbPRQEPCaJjgyVg4Kdc" alt="" />Meanwhile, the Nigerian Princeâ€¦ðŸ¤£</p>

<p>Still, as we know, every day thousands of people get scammed by Nigerian Prince tactic.</p>

<p>That means the scammerâ€™s ideal audience would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be naive and overly trusting</li>
  <li>Have little or no idea of online scams</li>
  <li>Be digitally inexperienced</li>
  <li>Be off-the guard</li>
  <li>Be too distracted to notice the typos and awkward phrasing</li>
  <li>Be financially in trouble or naturally greedy</li>
  <li>Believe in get-rich-quick schemes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thats-called-audience-persona">Thatâ€™s called audience persona</h3>

<p>The Nigerian Prince scammers have an ideal type of audience in their minds. And we just outlined their audienceâ€™s characterization. Thatâ€™s called audience persona.</p>

<p>In this case, we can call it their <strong>victimâ€™s persona</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, Iâ€™m not going to say that all of us are like the Nigerian Prince in our work.</p>

<p>But we certainly need to create some audience persona in our work.</p>

<h3 id="lets-take-an-example">Letâ€™s take an example.</h3>

<p>If youâ€™re creating an online survey, youâ€™d want to know a few things to make your survey as smooth as possible.</p>

<p>Youâ€™d want to understand your userâ€™s persona.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Do they understand English?</li>
  <li>Are they comfortable operating a smartphone?</li>
  <li>Is there good internet connectivity?</li>
  <li>When are they free to fill in your survey?</li>
  <li>What is their reading level?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="list-and-template">List and Template</h3>

<p>There are several types of persona depending on your needs.</p>

<p>Here, Iâ€™m sharing a looong list of parameters along with a filled template.</p>

<p>You donâ€™t need to use all the parameters, ideally 15-20 would work for most use cases.</p>

<p>Click on the images below to access and copy the Google Docs.</p>

<p>So, have you ever received any Nigerian Princeâ€™s email?</p>

<p>What was your first reaction?</p>

<p><strong>Hit Reply</strong> and share it with me.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t worry, I answer all the emails because there are not that many emails to answer.ðŸ˜„</p>
