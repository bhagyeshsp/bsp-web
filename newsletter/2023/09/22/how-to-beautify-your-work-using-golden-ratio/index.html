    <p>Tell me something Reader,</p>

<p>Do you believe that beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder?</p>

<p>I believe sometimes it is true, sometimes not.</p>

<p>There are some natural laws that apply to everyone, across the globe. Since the beginning of the time. Laws of what we find beautiful and what not.</p>

<p>I want to share with you one such law: <strong>golden ratio</strong>.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t worry, you donâ€™t have to be good at math to use it.</p>

<p>I have been using it for many years: in documents, presentations, photography, and designing.</p>

<p>It always works like a charm.</p>

<p>Look at these two slides:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/9KefGdMesPBn5mn6tM4Rmd" alt="" />Random slide-1</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/qUDnxDibwFyJU5jFydbrU2" alt="" />Random slide-2</p>

<p>They look impactful, donâ€™t they?</p>

<p>Try a similar arrangement in your PowerPoint software. Play with the placement, font size, etc.</p>

<p>Test it with your friends and colleagues and tell me what worked.</p>

<p>These two slides are based on Golden ratio.</p>

<h3 id="161803398875">1.61803398875</h3>

<p>Thatâ€™s the Golden Ratio.</p>

<p>We can use 1.618 for practical purposes.</p>

<p>This ratio appears frequently in nature and has been used for millennia in art and architecture.</p>

<p>But letâ€™s see how it works in our context.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/bjMbCtW5se7b3yP29U7YVT" alt="This is a Golden Rectangle.png" /></p>

<p>The ratio of its sides is <strong>1618/1000 = 1.618</strong></p>

<p>What if we change the dimension of one side?</p>

<p>Letâ€™s decrease the width from 1000 PX to 700 PX.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/46bPZoBeBn1zggwUXGcgbL" alt="This is Golden Rectangle (1).png" /></p>

<p>Now, this is no longer a golden ratio rectangle.</p>

<p>The ratio of the second rectangleâ€™s sides is <strong>1618/700 = 2.311</strong></p>

<p>It shows, huh?</p>

<p>Now, why are we not keeping the text in the center?</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a reason behind it.</p>

<h3 id="the-golden-spiral">The Golden Spiral</h3>

<p>When we start dividing a golden rectangleâ€™s sides, new golden rectangles start emerging.</p>

<p>For example, letâ€™s divide the rectangleâ€™s length at 1000th PX.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/itxJeVx1rcTTbxUXENucz1" alt="This is a Golden Rectangle (2).png" />Dividing a golden rectangle with 1000 px width</p>

<p>When we do this enough, something like this happens:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/vyYDyFsRbioSoPxDmkcyeW" alt="depositphotos_268904156_l-2015.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can create a spiral running through these dividing lines.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/9roaKdMKMU1KYSReEznJ8n" alt="golden-spiral.jpg" /></p>

<p>It is called a <strong>golden spiral.</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>eye of the spiral</strong> as you can see, sits slightly away from the center. Slightly near the dividing line.</p>

<p>That is where we can get the <strong>maximum attention</strong> of the audience/reader. It <em>feels</em> natural to look at it. Thatâ€™s why, our main object of attention has to be placed around the eye of the golden spiral.</p>

<p>Revisit the first slides I shared with you at the beginning, the titles are placed near the eye.</p>

<h3 id="use-in-photography">Use in photography</h3>

<p>Rule of thumb: place the object near the spiral eye.</p>

<p>Your photos will be enhanced instantly.</p>

<p>We donâ€™t look for symmetry, we look for balance in photos.</p>

<p>A few examples from the internet:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/nypfnvXfshF5bJGLvuAUS3" alt="crop-with-golden-spiral.jpg" />The photograph becomes more impactful by cropping it by golden ratio</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/d2uRPH3Qn7XRrK96eCfXQt" alt="depositphotos_109762514_l-2015.jpg" />Placement of object at the eye of the golden spiral</p>

<p>Pheww! Todayâ€™s letter contained the most number of images. I hope you found it helpful.</p>

<p>Had you heard about the Golden ratio before? What other concepts do you use in your work?</p>

<p>The title is self-explanatory. There is no other way but to exert emotional labor to stand out in current times. Emotional labor is a key point in my <a href="https://bhagyeshpathak.com/new-world-rules/">New World Rules</a>, published a few years back.</p>

<p>This â€˜School of Lifeâ€™ publication provides a much-needed pessimistic angle for the people who are already married or the ones who are yet to get married. I love their writing, something that all of us need to teach our kids.</p>

<p>David had penned down this post a decade ago. When everyone is hustling their way for the elusive thing called success and startup culture, he asks the reader to reconsider.</p>

<p>So, would you reconsider?</p>
