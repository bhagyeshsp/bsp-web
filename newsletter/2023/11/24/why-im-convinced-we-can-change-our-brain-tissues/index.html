    <p>So Reader, this really happened to me. And I‚Äôm not making it up.</p>

<p>In 2016, I purchased a book named The Prophet. Mostly because I had heard a lot about the author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran">Kahlil Gibran</a>. In fact, during my schooling, we had a Gujarati-translated prose from this book.</p>

<p>So, I thought to myself <em>alright, now I‚Äôm fluent in English, let‚Äôs read the original.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/cZKpRE3C2NSkVNMXrcta4d" alt="" /></p>

<p>When Flipkart delivered the copy to me, I opened it.</p>

<p>Andd, I just couldn‚Äôt understand what the author was saying.üòñ It was one of those moments where the critics appreciated some movie, but you watch it and wonder what exactly they found worthy of acclaim.</p>

<p>‚è©Fast forward to late 2020.</p>

<p>Out of boredom, I picked up the same copy from my closet.</p>

<p>And started flipping through it.</p>

<p>Instantly, it became my Geeta. My heartwarming home to retire. And I seriously believe that the spirit of the Universe has spoken through Kahlil Gibran in The Prophet.</p>

<p>But how did this happen?</p>

<p>How did an incomprehensible piece of text transform into a sacred home for me? Someone who couldn‚Äôt even gather the meaning in 2016.</p>

<h3 id="brain-changed">Brain changed</h3>

<p>In the period of 4 years, due to constant practice and reading abstract topics in English, the composition of the brain changed. It changed to fit the abstract content and make sense of it.</p>

<p>Now, that‚Äôs not my pet theory (though I have a hundred of such theories, this is not one of them)</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs see what I mean.</p>

<h3 id="the-backwards-brain-bicycle">The Backwards Brain Bicycle</h3>

<p>8 years ago Destin from the YouTube channel SmarterEveryday posted this incredible video of his brain transformation.</p>

<p>Watch this video and come back. (Duration: 07 minutes 57 seconds)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFzDaBzBlL0"><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/iLxwT1yVToT8xjC1hFkf6o" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt get to watch the video, here‚Äôs the summary (but hey, the video is much more fun than this):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Destin introduces a special kind of bicycle: a backward bicycle. Turning the handlebars left makes the wheel go right and vice versa</li>
  <li>He fails to ride the bicycle no matter what technique he uses</li>
  <li>But, after 8 months of practice, he can ride the backward bicycle</li>
  <li>His 6-year-old son learns to ride in just 2 weeks!</li>
  <li>When Destin tries to ride a normal bicycle, he can not. Although he eventually learns it in 20 minutes</li>
  <li>Watch the fun video with people attempting to ride the backward bicycle</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="destin-is-right-its-neuroplasticity">Destin is right, it‚Äôs neuroplasticity</h3>

<p>When Destin and his son learned to ride the backwards cycle, they literally created new neural networks in their brain.</p>

<p>This process is called neuroplasticity. This is the same process that makes us learn anything: from hard skills to soft skills.</p>

<p>Let me share another great story where people have learned outstanding skills by literally shaping their brain.</p>

<h3 id="the-polg√°r-sisters-chess-prodigies">The <strong>Polg√°r sisters: chess prodigies</strong></h3>

<p>The Polg√°r sisters were part of an educational experiment by their father L√°szl√≥ Polg√°r. Being an educational psychologist, he and his wife decided to test their belief that ‚ÄúGeniuses are made, not born‚Äù.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/6b7A5J4sHb9f4Fg3P9pcXp" alt="" /></p>

<p>They married and provided their three daughters nothing but chess education. No Barbie dolls, toys, or other distractions. Just chess.</p>

<p>Two sisters earned the title of Grand Master and the third one earned Woman Grand Master at a very young age.</p>

<h3 id="of-course-we-dont-need-to-drop-everything-we-are-doing">Of course, we don‚Äôt need to drop everything we are doing‚Ä¶</h3>

<p>‚Ä¶and become a chess grandmaster, or learn that weird backward bicycle.</p>

<p><strong>‚Äã</strong></p>

<p><strong>The point is‚Ä¶</strong></p>

<p><strong>The point is‚Ä¶.</strong></p>

<p>The point is that we can change our brain tissues.</p>

<p>We can learn anything.</p>

<p>Literally, anything in the world.</p>

<p>Remember my letter <a href="https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/tfn9-do-you-look-at-the-keyboard-while-typing/">Do you look at the keyboard while typing?</a> I assure you, I have seen neuroplasticity in action. My fingers rhythming on the keyboard week after week, month after month, and now‚Ä¶just typing as I think.</p>

<p><strong>Have you experienced the feeling of learning?</strong></p>

<p>Anything, no matter how tiny or big.</p>

<p>Learning cursive writing, or embroidering or a tiny software or coding or‚Ä¶just anything.</p>

<p><strong>Reads of the week:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/opinion/teenagers-mental-health-treatment.html"><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/ejf74aBLJhWnqH1uGSgWMk" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In this New York Times guest essay, clinical psychologist Dr. Saxbe argues that the wide-scale launch of mental health awareness and mitigation programs after Covid are not only unhelpful, but they‚Äôre damaging.</p>

<p>Dr. Saxbe‚Äôs essay affirms my personal experience of dealing with people around me and my observations over the past three years.</p>

<p>Teenagers are feeling triggered due to some of the most normal occurrences of life. The problem is the internet exposure. When you learn that so-and-so discomfort is called anxiety, you start labeling incidents that would have been otherwise labeled normal.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs called the ‚Äúhammer and nail‚Äù approach. To a man who is holding a hammer, everything else looks like a nail.</p>

<p>Nowadays, most of the articles provide ‚ÄúTW‚Äù (Trigger Warning). I‚Äôm no exception. When I shared the draft of my May 2020 article <a href="https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/in-for-collateral-damage-anyone/">In for collateral damage? Anyone?</a> One of my closest friends advised me to add a trigger warning. It is still there. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the best decision.</p>
