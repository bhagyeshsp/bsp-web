    <p>If you‚Äôre a fan of suspense thriller movies like me, you‚Äôd have seen one of these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_board">murder maps</a> in some scenes. (I didn‚Äôt know it is called that until now)</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/tNypaTZPJbRVkxL4vejH9f" alt="" /></p>

<p>What I love about those boards is, how easy it is for a viewer to understand what is going on. No matter how complicated the movie storyline.</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>This leads to one of my favorite things: explaining things. I mean I just can‚Äôt let go of that instinct. And over the years, I have mostly used pen and paper. In recent years, I have tried flowcharting, cartooning, spreadsheeting, Jam-boarding, etc.</p>

<p>But something has always been lacking.</p>

<h3 id="the-murder-map-feeling">The murder map feeling</h3>

<p>When you try to explain your project, your work, or a problem to your colleague, or an audience of 50 people, if you can‚Äôt make them feel ‚Äúclick‚Äù, you would know that. I‚Äôm calling it a murder map feeling. Murder maps are so widespread due to movies that, people just get dragged into them.</p>

<h3 id="consider-this">Consider this</h3>

<p>Which of the following depictions would interest you?</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/2BUyKU6D9tG3yN5WLo64fZ?ar=16%3A9&amp;fit=crop" alt="" /><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/LY9QhmMWrKnfvQrqYVMw8?ar=16%3A9&amp;fit=crop" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is natural to be drawn toward the image on the right-hand side. It has photos, non-distracting arrows, and a feeling. A feeling of relatability.</p>

<h3 id="so-murder-maps-for-presentations">So, murder maps for presentations?</h3>

<p>Of course not! But I have been tinkering with this free tool that has all the elements that make presenting complex information easy to depict. More real than standard flow charts or jam boards.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/8PRnMScyhX3MDycgHAqCHe" alt="" />It took me just 2 minutes to sketch all these elements</p>

<p>Try this free tool by visiting https://excalidraw.com</p>

<p>Ironically, I‚Äôm not providing any steps for this. It is quite self-explanatory and fun to play around. But if you hit a roadblock, let me know.</p>

<p>Give it a try and let me know how you like it.</p>
