    <p>The first time I came across the concept of a real computer password was when I was around 16 years old. That password set by my father, got so popular in our family that we still use some version of that password even for our home WiFi. And that password is good enough for us.</p>

<p>But a few years back, I came across an infographic resembling this:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/exjnAtLYQzByKQrDS8PiKa" alt="" /></p>

<p>It was shocking!<br />
No matter how much I might have tried to protect my online passwords, one wrong website and I‚Äôd be done for.</p>

<p>With most of our knowledge work happening over the internet, it is important to have strong and memorable passwords. (Especially if you‚Äôre not using a specialized password manager)</p>

<p>So, that‚Äôs what I want to converse about today:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Checking the strength of the password</li>
  <li>Generating new memorable passwords</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="but-before-that">But before that</h2>

<p>We have to understand that not all websites and passwords need to be super-secured. If you‚Äôre using some free services, you can use a temporary email such as  (I will be writing a letter on this)</p>

<h2 id="what-type-of-accounts-should-you-review">What type of accounts should you review?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Your main Google Account password</li>
  <li>Your iCloud Account password</li>
  <li>Your Net Banking password</li>
  <li>Any work-related cloud database password</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="check-your-password-strength">Check your password strength</h2>

<p>This website I‚Äôm talking about checks your password strength, it doesn‚Äôt store. It calculates the strength of your password offline. You can check by disconnecting the internet connection.</p>

<p><strong>Step-1:</strong> Go to <a href="https://www.passwordmonster.com/">https://www.passwordmonster.com</a>‚Äã<br />
‚Äã<strong>Step-2:</strong> Type your password and see the password cracking time</p>

<p>I entered my home WiFi password, the time it will take is: 0.35 seconds!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm relaxed because not all passwords should be treated equally.</p>

<p>It displays that my password has 10 characters, containing lowercase letters and numbers.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/Kg5ajam5tGh9akEA7U8bX" alt="" /></p>

<p>But for important things, we need to keep a secure password.<br />
For example, this is the strength of one of my important cloud database passwords:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/74hKdxujtsQj8qg5k1XpMz" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you have checked your important passwords, and you want to change them, you can generate memorable passwords.</p>

<h2 id="generating-strong-and-memorable-passwords">Generating strong and memorable passwords</h2>

<p>There are many free websites that offer this facility, you can use whichever you like. But one that I found useful is this one:</p>

<h2 id="1password-generator">‚Äã<a href="https://1password.com/password-generator/">1Password Generator</a>‚Äã</h2>

<p>Once you go to this page, you can generate passwords. I chose a ‚Äúmemorable password‚Äù with 4 word counts.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/7DtovEhqjfQB2YdHrkSvFb" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can generate as many passwords as you want.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs check the strength of this generated password:<br />
‚Äã<strong>athens-furbish-toweling-ions</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/tM36JJNj6twDEESDgkQufo" alt="" /></p>

<p>Whooooaaahh!<br />
This 28-character password password would take 793,000,000,000 years for a computer to crack. Impressive.</p>

<h3 id="but-what-if-the-website-mandates-you-to-use-special-characters-numbers-and-upper-case-letters">But what if the website mandates you to use special characters, numbers and upper case letters?</h3>

<p>Simple, use some sort of standard memorable sequence as a prefix or a suffix.</p>

<p>For example, I like this memorable password we generated.<br />
But the website mandates me to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At least one upper-case letter</li>
  <li>At least one number</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I will modify the password like this:<br />
‚Äã<strong>$2024Athens-furbish-toweling-ions</strong></p>

<p>And the password strength?<br />
Let‚Äôs check:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/o6YemxViJmDcUUvNtpHjw6" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>That‚Äôs 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 years!</strong></p>

<h2 id="final-notes">Final notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It goes without saying that we need to keep passwords unique and <strong>never reuse</strong> them across important websites.</li>
  <li>Substituting special characters in words is not a smart move if the overall password is an English dictionary word:<br />
For example: @dm!n<br />
Hackers are aware of this practice and the algorithms check the possibility of substitution a million times per second and crack it.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you‚Äôre surprised by the demise of your favourite password after checking its strength, cry a river, build a bridge and get over it.<br />
We need strong passwords more than ever.<br />
‚Äã<strong>Hit Reply</strong> and share any password-related poor practices you may have observed in your personal or work life.</p>

<p>What happens when we want to discuss some taboo topics in the business world? That‚Äôs what Jessica, the co-founder of the billion-dollar startup accelerator YC talks about in this essay.<br />
Jessica makes the case that the culture has taken some subjects off the table. This costs the world the insights that would fuel innovation, solutions and better lives.<br />
I get it when she says this, because the culture, the world is hell-bent on its current belief that you can‚Äôt risk expressing or discussing what you observe.</p>
