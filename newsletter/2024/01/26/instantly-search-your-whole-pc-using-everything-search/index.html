    <p>Okay, so today‚Äôs letter is specifically for Windows users. Because anyone using a Mac, has been blessed with an in-built instant search.</p>

<p>So, if you want to be as blessed as an average Mac user, read on.</p>

<h3 id="the-day-i-stopped-using-the-windows-search-box">The day I stopped using the Windows Search box</h3>

<p>I don‚Äôt remember that day. But it was many years back. But I remember feeling utterly frustrated over many years. Until that day when I just stopped searching for files using the default Search Box. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd have also given up on it like me. See our villain in the red box. No, not the work. The search box!</p>

<h3 id="then-i-tried-google-desktop">Then I tried Google Desktop</h3>

<p>In early 2008, I got my hands on Google Desktop. And it blew my mind. Imagine the power of Google algorithm for your PC files and folders. But alas, it was <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">killed by Google</a> around 2012. On a side note, Google has killed around 293 products so far, as noted by killedbygoogle site. Visit it to stroll down the memory lane.</p>

<h3 id="enters-everything-search">Enters Everything Search</h3>

<p>One of my friends suggested Everything Search two years back. And it was everything that I needed. See that Magnifying Glass icon in my taskbar? That‚Äôs Everything Search.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/jwJ8TbBoaUwyyhDx6i1Zmq" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="this-is-how-it-works">This is how it works</h3>

<p><strong>Step-1:</strong><a href="https://www.voidtools.com/">Download</a> and install Everything Search on your Windows machine. It‚Äôs free.</p>

<p><strong>Step-2:</strong> You don‚Äôt need to do in this step. But if I remember correctly, when you run the application for the first time, it will take 2-3 minutes to index all files and folders on your PC. Indexing means it creates a searchable directory for its library.</p>

<p><strong>Step-3:</strong> As you begin typing in the search box, it will instantly show the results. For example, I intended to search for ‚ÄúThe Friday newsletter‚Äù, but I got the results as I was typing. (And oh by the way, <a href="https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/tfn9-do-you-look-at-the-keyboard-while-typing/">do you still look at the keyboard while typing?</a>)</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/2gXq5jym868PF99aDp47Zv" alt="" /></p>

<p>That‚Äôs it. It is that easy.</p>

<h3 id="other-features-that-i-love-in-everything-search">Other features that I love in Everything Search</h3>

<p>It has another bunch of features. I will cover two helpful features.</p>

<p><strong>Feature-1: Searching for only specific file type</strong></p>

<p>If you are looking for just a specific file type, say images, then you can apply that filter first. Makes the work faster.</p>

<p>Go to the Search Menu and you can select which file type you are looking for.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/gRhLnuvQWnkWaJhm2SWLMQ" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Feature-2: Adding external drive or other folders</strong></p>

<p>What if you want to search for something inside your 1TB external hard drive?</p>

<p>Go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Folders Add your preferred folder and search inside it.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/iF7YdMShukh89gRz93fCN" alt="" /></p>

<p>So, that‚Äôs what I use.</p>

<p>Have you also felt the same Windows search struggle?</p>

<p><strong>Hit Reply</strong> and tell me about it.</p>

<p><strong>Reads of the week:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/business/esg-funds-withdrawals.html"><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/5XVEBfFmYFsaPB6u2BPiMa" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Don‚Äôt be fooled by two things: the term ‚ÄúESG‚Äù and the second part of this headline ‚Äúpolitical heat‚Äù.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre investing your hard-earned money in Equity markets, you‚Äôd have been enamored by this new Environmental, Sustainability, and Governance barometer. Virtue-signalling cannot be a good business model. Most investors are realizing it now and pulling their money back. It‚Äôs not due to any political heat as the NYT is enunciating.</p>

<p>I need to write a dedicated essay on it, but if you‚Äôre pouring your money into a stock that values ‚ÄúDiversity, equity, inclusion, environment, sustainability‚Äù, you need to think twice. Over the long term, the market is efficient and it can differentiate between what‚Äôs genuine and what‚Äôs a scam.</p>

<p>I love seeing and investing in good businesses. Especially if they don‚Äôt tout themselves as DEI and ESG-compliant. Because they‚Äôre at least not wasting my money to fool me.</p>

<p>All this reminds me of this quote from beloved <strong>Ayn Rand</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>‚ÄúRun for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the leper‚Äôs bell of an approaching looter.‚Äù</strong></p>
