<p>Did you know that the word Google is based on the word <em>“Googol”</em>, a mathematical term for the number one followed by a hundred zeros? Crazy, right?</p>

<p>I remembered all this for most of my adult life.<br />
​<strong>But I have forgotten about Google’s existence for the last 1 year.</strong></p>

<h2 id="because-now-i-have-been-using-perplexityai">Because now I have been using perplexity.ai</h2>

<p>I don’t want to beat around the bush.<br />

<h2 id="googles-weaknesses-are-perplexitys-strengths">Google’s weaknesses are Perplexity’s strengths</h2>

<p>All my complaints about Google’s poor search results have vanished due to perplexity’s real-time surfing and exact answers.<br />
It is like ChatGPT but better at browsing and referencing.<br />
Perplexity doesn’t throw a bunch of 20 pages with matching terms, it understands our query and summarizes the references for us.</p>

<h2 id="plus-perplexity-also-plays-the-role-of-chatgpt">Plus perplexity also plays the role of ChatGPT</h2>

<p>Though I dedicatedly use ChatGPT for AI-aided tasks, perplexity is also excellent at similar tasks.</p>

<h2 id="google-doesnt-come-close-2nd">Google doesn’t come close 2nd</h2>

<p>Perplexity is an excellent research tool. You ask questions, provide documents, receive images, and videos..and everything is hyper-contextual.<br />
No BS.<br />
Google just throws a bunch of indexed results at us and we are supposed to make sense of them. It feels like the Stone Age.</p>

<p>So, if you haven’t tried or not using it regularly, pls give it a try and let me know.</p>

<p>In case you have already been using perplexity or anything similar, would you like to share it with me?<br />

<p><strong>Reads of the week:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/beasleydavid/2020/02/20/google-removes-gender-descriptions-on-ai-tool/"><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/rbtEdYW7FTyuwS4GmN4Fdo" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Speaking of Google, one of the reasons Google couldn’t innovate in its category is due to its reverence for certain kind of ideology.</p>

<p>There is something called as <strong>sexual dimorphism</strong> in the animal kingdom. Due to sexual dimorphism, the two sexes look different. AI too, can tell the difference between a man and a woman by looking at the face.</p>

<p>But because “gender is a social construct”, in 2020, Google removed the feature that recognizes men and women differently in their AI tool.</p>

<p>What a waste.</p>

<p>By the way, did you know that this week, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit">United States federal court ruled Google to be a monopoly?</a> Let’s hope Google is forced to disintegrate and begins working on building a better search engine.</p>
