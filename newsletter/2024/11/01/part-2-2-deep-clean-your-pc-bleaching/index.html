    <p>Hi Reader,<br />
How’s your Diwali week progressing?<br />
I hope you had a good one.<br />
Wishing you a happy Diwali week.<br />
Today, I won’t take long. Because I’ve got to be somewhere and you’ve got to relax.<br />
I hope you began cleaning your PC as per last week’s conversation. It is something that no software can do automatically.</p>

<h2 id="automatic-cleaning-today">Automatic cleaning today</h2>

<p>We will use an automatic software for today’s micro-cleaning.<br />
You just have to select which parts of your PC you want to get cleaned and then press GO.<br />
It is like chemical wash—as if bleaching. You don’t need to move a muscle and still the cleaning happens.</p>

<h2 id="micro-cleaning-using-bleachbit">Micro-cleaning using <a href="https://www.bleachbit.org/download">BleachBit</a>​</h2>

<p>I have used some other cleaning software most of my life. But this one beats them all.<br />
It is fully free and open-source (we will talk more about the meaning of open-source and some funny things about how people are abusing this term).<br />
So, just head over to BleachBit’s <a href="https://www.bleachbit.org/download">download page</a> and install it on your system. (Yes, it is available for almost all popular Operating Systems)</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it?</h2>

<h3 id="step-1">Step-1</h3>

<p>Once installed, BleachBit would take a few seconds to scan your PC and understand which different software and browsers you use. So that it can check their temporary files, cache etc.<br />
My screen looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/s45374cMMbtKExx9MMw4gr" alt="1 32.png" /></p>

<p>By default, the checkboxes would be unchecked.<br />
A word of caution, Checking “Deep Scan” would reset many of your PC settings, so I recommend not checking it.</p>

<h3 id="step-2">Step-2</h3>

<p>Once you have done the checking, you will need to click the first two buttons.<br />
When you hit “Preview”, it will begin scanning for removal. But will not clean. It will just gather and show you how much space it would be able to free.<br />
This step would take 5-10 minutes, depending on the junk files on your PC.<br />
​</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/3zhAha2PbNeFsEjetMVLsy" alt="2 32.png" /></p>

<h3 id="step-3">Step-3</h3>

<p>Before you hit “Clean”, please make sure that you <em>really</em> want to delete your Form History and Passwords from your browser.<br />
If you save passwords to your browser, please UNCHECK these boxes. There’s no undo button once cleaned.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/jr5vUtsU4e7A96D8yHeyu" alt="3 33.png" /></p>

<h3 id="step-4">Step-4</h3>

<p>Now hit “Clean”. The software will take its time cleaning your files.<br />
At any moment in time, if you want to stop cleaning, hit “Abort”.</p>

<h3 id="step-5">Step-5</h3>

<p>Once cleaning is over, you can check the individual cleaning logs. Once satisfied, restart your PC. Restarting will remove any temporary files and repair any broken file paths.</p>

<p>And now your PC is spick-and-span.</p>

It can clone anyone and make them act, dress and talk naturally. <strong>There’s a surprise in this video.</strong> Find it out.</p>
