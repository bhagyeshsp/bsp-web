    <p>Tell me something, would you step into a river that is on average 4 feet deep?<br />
Take a pause. If your mind shouted NO right away, you donâ€™t need to look at this illustration:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/qbP7Ez5hG1sK9jQnSKWyM2" alt="0 11.png" /></p>

<p>See? Averages are tricky.<br />
Most of the time, they play with our intuition and lead us to bad decisions.</p>

<h3 id="stock-derivatives-river">STOCK DERIVATIVES RIVER</h3>

<p>One of my favourite averages is the recent Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaâ€™s (SEBI) <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/over-93-retail-traders-lost-money-in-f-o-in-three-years-says-sebi-124092300853_1.html">research outcome</a> : approximately <strong>93%</strong> of equity derivative traders have incurred an average loss of <em>Rs 2 lakh (per trader)</em> during the last three financial years.<br />
Imagine the deadly depths of this river!</p>

<p>â€‹</p>

<p>Now <em>thatâ€™s</em> a river I wouldnâ€™t dare step into without expertise.<br />
In any case, the knowledge work that most of us are involved in doesnâ€™t contain derivative trading or stepping into rivers.<br />
But many of us deal with dashboards every day.</p>

<h2 id="dashboard-mania">Dashboard mania</h2>

<p>Most organizations have been frenzy about having dashboards for some time now. This began a few years back due to the increased computing power of PCs, better internet connectivity and the upgradation of the technology stack of webpages.<br />
A few months back, we had discussed different aspects of the problems with dashboards and mistakes in <a href="https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/%f0%9f%aa%9c5-mistakes-i-avoid-while-designing-my-dashboards/">5 mistakes I avoid while designing my dashboards</a>â€‹<br />
The three problems I had highlighted were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dashboards are treated as a cure for all problems</li>
  <li>Only for managers</li>
  <li>The gap between decision-maker and decision</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="but-the-main-problem-averages">But the main problem: Averages</h2>

<p>Other organizational, humane and management problems aside, the main problem is that most dashboards show averages.<br />
Consider this image that I had shared in the said letter:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/mhFSKDc4RFFJ7j7mRghEsg" alt="1 30.png" /></p>

<p>In your business, the real data might be coming from 100 different locations in a large geographic area.<br />
As a business owner or a high-level manager, the dashboard would provide an aggregate, average idea of the the business activity health.</p>

<h2 id="4-feet-depth-on-display">4 feet depth on display</h2>

<p>Your dashboard shows you the 4 feet depth of the river. Of course, the modern dashboards provide the facility to drill several levels deeper (but how often do you click 5 levels deep and corroborate the data?).<br />
In other words, dashboards tend to do two things:</p>

<h3 id="1-making-good-business-look-bad">1. Making good business look bad</h3>

<p>If the average sales data of your 50 salespeople show bad business, that overshadows the good business brought in by the individuals.</p>

<h3 id="2-making-bad-business-look-good">2. Making bad business look good</h3>

<p>On the other hand, if the average sales data of your 50 salespeople shows good business, it hides the bad business brought in by the individuals.<br />
In essence, averages play with our intuition, mood and consequently decision-making.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-solution">So whatâ€™s the solution?</h2>

<p>Giving more power to your people. By investing in a design that provides a personalized experience.<br />
Most importantly, not showing averages or percentages.<br />
Look at this stock management screen I created sometime back. Ignore the discrepancy in the sample data and look at the quantity of Curd. It doesnâ€™t tell the person that 75% curd is available.<br />
Instead, it tells the person that the curd status is GREEN at the moment and it is 750 gram.<br />
The person will make necessary the decision depending on this information.</p>

<p><strong>Reads of the week:</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-is-teslas-coming-robotaxi-such-a-big-deal">Why is Teslaâ€™s coming Robotaxi such a big deal?</h2>

<p>â€‹<a href="https://x.com/Scobleizer/status/1843478107237601335">Link</a>â€‹<br />
What would be the soon-to-be future of transportation?<br />
In this post, Robert argues that out of the all Robotaxi brands currently available in select US cities, Teslaâ€™s upcoming Robotaxi is going to dominate the market. He provides some interesting insights about why he thinks so.<br />
I havenâ€™t ridden a Robotaxi yet, so letâ€™s see when I get to experience it and maybe I will be able to verify Robertâ€™s claims.</p>
