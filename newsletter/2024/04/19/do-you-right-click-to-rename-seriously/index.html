    <p>No, I‚Äôm not judging.</p>

<p>But I‚Äôm curious.</p>

<p>When you rename a file in your PC (assuming it‚Äôs a Windows machine), do you point at the file icon using the mouse, then right-click (or double-click) to ‚Äúrename‚Äù the file or folder?</p>

<p>Isn‚Äôt that, too much effort?</p>

<p>I mean think about it. You have to use one hand to right-click/double-click on the interested file, and hit ‚Äúrename‚Äù. Then shift the hands on the keyboard to rename the file.</p>

<p>What if you have to rename 10 files?</p>

<p>That will have 10 slow-motion rename operations.</p>

<h3 id="today-i-want-to-share-just-one-thing-f2">Today, I want to share just one thing: F2</h3>

<p>Function key F2 on your keyboard.</p>

<p>If you think I‚Äôm being lazy by writing such a short letter today, be it. But if you had to change only one thing in your knowledge work, make use of F2 to rename files.</p>

<p>I see so many people going the long road of right-clicks.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Perhaps they‚Äôre afraid of hotkeys. But you can‚Äôt memorize all the hotkeys in a single sitting. You don‚Äôt need to. As you begin adopting hotkeys for daily functions, the brain begins to develop an appetite for more hotkeys. And then you begin feeding your brain.</p>

<p>It is that easy.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre already using F2 and other hotkeys, look around at how many people take the long road. And you will understand why I had to bring up this tiny matter in this letter.</p>

<p>I have only one question for you: do you use F2?</p>

<p><strong>Hit Reply</strong> and tell me. I won‚Äôt judge.</p>
