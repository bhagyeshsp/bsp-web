  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Recently, I published my idea of facilitation on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bhagyeshpathak_we-are-all-facilitators-i-dont-know-when-activity-7170751369690267649-qfbG?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">We are all facilitators</a>. Many readers and friends found it relatable. That got me thinking.</p>

<p>What is a running theme of the people I enjoyed working with?</p>

<p>What exactly is it that I cherish about some of the people I worked with over the years?</p>

<p>Why do people want to work with those people?</p>

<p><strong>In short, what is so special about their facilitation?</strong></p>

<p>I don’t know. I couldn’t come up with any answer right away.</p>

<p>But with enough thinking, I understood that they provide eustress (good stress) to their associates. Here, we don’t want to get into the classic “good stress” or “bad stress” comparison. Comparisons don’t get us anywhere.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-people-say-about-them">What do people say about them?</h3>

<p>What do people say about someone they enjoy working with?</p>

<p>You will never hear them say “I love working with him/her because I don’t need to work at all!”</p>

<p>No, but what you’re most likely to hear is “I just learn soo much while working with him/her. Sure, sometimes we work overtime, but it is fun.”</p>

<p>This is a consistent theme.</p>

<p>So, how can we evolve to become somebody with whom people want to associate?</p>

<h3 id="but-before-that-lets-understand-eustress-first">But before that, let’s understand eustress first</h3>

<p>If we ask anyone today, most people end up complaining about how depressive the world is getting, or how they’re yet to get their much-awaited promotion, and that keeps them up at night, etc.</p>

<p>In general, stress levels are high. That is the kind of stress that makes people burn out, and not feel alive.</p>

<h3 id="thats-because-we-have-eliminated-eustress-from-our-lives">That’s because we have eliminated eustress from our lives</h3>

<p>Eustress is also known as beneficial stress.</p>

<p>Think about the joy that we get by doing something that we normally don’t get to do. Things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixing a leaking tap</li>
  <li>Preparing dinner for 10 guests</li>
  <li>Cleaning the home</li>
  <li>Handwriting letters</li>
  <li>Visiting bank</li>
  <li>Waiting in a queue for our favorite restaurant</li>
  <li>Shopping in a small market</li>
  <li>Bargaining over grocery price tag</li>
  <li>Waiting for an upcoming movie in the cinema hall</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re getting to do many of the similar things, chances are, you’d be an optimistic, above-average fellow.</p>

<p>But most modern people don’t need to indulge in these tasks due to the convenience of modernity.</p>

<h3 id="and-in-such-a-world-someone-pushes-you">And in such a world, someone pushes you</h3>

<p>And…in such a boring, too-convenient world, someone at work pushes you. They know how much to push you. And they do it in such a respectful, ambitious manner that you can’t help but give in.</p>

<p>That’s how you get into your growth zone as discussed a few weeks back in: <a href="https://bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/%f0%9f%aa%9c-there-are-more-comfort-zones-than-you-think-use-them-effectively/">There are more comfort zones than you think, use them effectively</a>​</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/ifFM9eg8RmdgmKHeZRRXfw" alt="" /></p>

<p>When the work is complete, we feel thrilled. Joyed.</p>

<h3 id="why-wouldnt-we">Why wouldn’t we?</h3>

<p>I mean why wouldn’t we feel that thrill? That joy?</p>

<p>Learning that you can push your boundaries and accomplish something, is one of the best thrilling experiences one can have.</p>

<p>People talk about the IKEA effect, but it is not the IKEA effect alone. It is knowing that we assembled a tedious piece of furniture and did it with grace. Completed it beautifully. That joy is incredible.</p>

<h3 id="so-shall-we-start-challenging-people">So, shall we start challenging people?</h3>

<p>Before we decide to challenge people around us, we have to develop an understanding of their personality, competence, strengths, and whatnot.</p>

<p>Mere challenging someone doesn’t create eustress. It has to be well-planned, and well-intentioned.</p>

<p>We shouldn’t look for challenging people. But to help them reach their next potential version in a way that aligns with them.</p>

<p>I know today’s letter might be heavy with words, but what needs to be said, needs to be said. What are some of your memories of working with some amazing people?</p>

<p><strong>Reads of the week:</strong></p>

<p>If you haven’t heard about Google’s latest Gemini scandal, it is okay. Most of the legacy media outlets have suppressed the story as if nothing happened.</p>

<p>Google had programmed its Gemini AI to be “diverse” — which it has done with its search results for years. But now, with the AI, things become easily detectable.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/w8wDDCKLRHY8sm5h6iQhpf" alt="" />Example of Google’s DEI-infected AI</p>

<p>And that is what happened. Gemini AI was indoctrinated with the “Diversity, Equity, Inclusion” ideology, so much so that it didn’t generate a single Straight White Male image, even for historical reference.</p>

<p>Thinking people saw this coming many years back.</p>

<p>Here are two unmissable pieces on the entire Gemini Saga and what it means for users like us.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1760271594679845272"><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/4repnYnxWuHqk2fsNM9rAY" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Balaji has been the voice of free expression, and government-free governance for a long time. When he writes, I can’t help but read.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/google-culture-of-fear"><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/nXhNXBB2MZ5TtKJJ8S8jsy" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I have shared Mike’s techno-ideologic pieces in the past too. This one is enlightening as the Pirate Wires team interviews Google staff to understand how they operate.</p>

<p>One thing is clear, with the current leadership and the DEI hivemind, Google is never going to out-innovate other firms such as OpenAI or Tesla. What’s more, AI is going to eat up Google’s search ad revenue and it will begin falling in itself like a dying star.</p>

<p>Unless.</p>

<p>Unless there is leadership and wide-scale cleaning inside Google.</p>
