<p>Now imagine, what would happen when managers and their team members might be meeting once a year to discuss where they need improvement?</p>

<p>I guess a complete disaster!</p>

<p>Because it is so difficult to name the skills that apply to a knowledge worker. And in a conversation such as appraisal, if you can’t name something, it doesn’t exist.</p>

<h3 id="my-obsession-with-self-appraisal">My obsession with self-appraisal</h3>

<p>If you have come across my <a href="bhagyeshpathak.com/blog/appraisal-of-appraisals">appraisal of appraisals</a> article, you’d already be knowing my contentions with the entire appraisal process and my suggested solution: self-appraisal.</p>

<p>During the same time when I had written “Appraisal of appraisals”, I had come across skill cards. They’re free soft copies of cards that you can use for self-appraisal. If you have a supportive manager or guide, even you can invite them to participate as well.</p>

<h3 id="100-skill-cards">100+ Skill Cards</h3>

<p>These beautiful skill cards were developed by mobile.de and were made public for everyone’s use on the <a href="https://miro.com/">Miro tool</a>. (That’s a beautiful free tool on which I create most of the illustrations you see in my letters) Look at some of the card samples here:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/pNpd8UKtfCjp3cPjQgUFvB" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="how-to-access-these-cards">How to access these cards?</h3>

<p>All you need to do to access these cards is create an account on Miro if you don’t have one. And then head to this link:  And hit “Use Template” That’s it.</p>

<h3 id="self-appraisal-using-skill-cards">Self-appraisal using skill cards</h3>

<p>Though all instructions are provided in Miro’s skill cardboard, you can skip all the nitty-gritty and focus on only three things:</p>

<p><strong>Non-focus cards:</strong> sort out any cards that are irrelevant to your work</p>

<p><strong>Good enough cards:</strong> the skills that are good enough for your current or future work</p>

<p><strong>To improve cards:</strong> the skills that you need to work on to reach your future career path</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/v2nnqvMMyBE4SJ5pyRTsJG" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="make-it-more-interesting">Make it more interesting</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, you can invite your manager or guide on Miro and ask them to sort the cards in these buckets for you. What do they think about your skills?</p>

<p>This would provide you with a better, personalized review of where you stand.</p>

<p>Like the idea? <strong>Hit Reply</strong> tell me or share with me about how you used the skill cards. Or even better, tell me if any other technique works for you.</p>

<p>We are aware of how difficult it is to get independent research funded in this increasingly ideology-driven world. Because money guides the agenda. It makes the best of the minds to kneel and accept somebody else’s biases.</p>

<p>In such an academically stagnated world, this just two-year-old institute serves as a beacon of hope. Possibly, the last land for a free and fair scientific inquiry. Curiosity. Exploration. And real Impact.</p>

<p>So, when I learned about Arc Institute and its administrative setup, I couldn’t help but share it with you. Interested in learning more? Read their <a href="https://arcinstitute.org/about">about page</a>.</p>
