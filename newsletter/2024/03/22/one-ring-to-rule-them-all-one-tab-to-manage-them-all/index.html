    <p>Reader, I want to ask you something.</p>

<p>Does your browser window look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/wMjRFeBacyxKUuXdnMJPY6" alt="" /></p>

<p>If it does, don‚Äôt worry, mine used to look the same until a few years ago. We are all addicted to a secret disease called ‚Äú<strong>tabbed browsing</strong>‚Äú.</p>

<p>Mozilla introduced this feature of ‚Äútabbed browsing‚Äù somewhere around 2003. And the users loved it. So much so, that most people can‚Äôt fathom the fact that initial years of personal computing allowed only opening in ‚Äúnew window‚Äù. No concept of tabs.</p>

<p>But every new solution gives rise to a new set of problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-with-tabbed-browsing">The problem with tabbed browsing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Eats up most of your computer memory</li>
  <li>Divides internet bandwidth</li>
  <li>Distracts the computer user</li>
</ul>

<p>And I‚Äôm pretty sure, you might be facing many more problems with crowded tabs. But might be trapped in the ‚ÄúI hate it, but I love it‚Äù cycle.</p>

<h3 id="onetab">OneTab</h3>

<p>If you think about it, we don‚Äôt need more than one tab to capture all the multiple tabs. And we don‚Äôt need to do any manual work.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs already an extension named OneTab. I began using it a couple of years ago and I haven‚Äôt looked back.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/r5Bty7oaoy9wS22Ma3jRFF" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="whats-the-central-idea">What‚Äôs the central idea</h3>

<p>OneTab extension creates a tab named OneTab in your browser. It sits in your browser. Whenever your browser gets crowded, you hit the OneTab icon in the extension tray.</p>

<p>And what does it do?</p>

<p>It cleans up all your tabs by shifting in the OneTab tab. You can instantly organize, remove, group, lock, and export your tabs as you wish.</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/dQrTMHPPwLRPf6a9EKREY1" alt="" />Can you imagine I have access to 77 tabs under OneTab right now?</p>

<h3 id="the-steps">The steps</h3>

<p><strong>Step-1:</strong> Install <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall">OneTab extension</a>. If you‚Äôre using Mozilla or Safari, it might be available there too.</p>

<p><strong>Step-2:</strong> Pin the OneTab extension to the browser tray. This would help you hit the icon as many times as you want.</p>

<p><strong>Step-3:</strong> Open all the tabs that you want to work on. Complete your work. And‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Step-4:</strong> Hit OneTab extension. Ta-da!</p>

<p><strong>Step-5:</strong> Organize the tabs as you like. For example, I have a dedicated group of tabs that I use daily. I have grouped them.</p>

<h3 id="powerful-features">Powerful features</h3>

<p>OneTab has innovated more than any other product in this category.</p>

<p>I want to share two powerful features that are available in OneTab. If you regularly need to share your URLs with someone or need to copy-paste them, you‚Äôd benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Exporting URLs</strong></p>

<p>You have two options:</p>

<p>1. Export/copy-paste ALL URLs in OneTab</p>

<p>2. Export only SELECTED group of tabs</p>

<p><strong>Sharing as webpage</strong></p>

<p>This is even more interesting. You can generate a live webpage that lists your selected URLs. Anyone with the link can access the shared webpage.</p>

<p>Here too, you have two options:</p>

<p>1. Share ALL URLs as a webpage</p>

<p>2. Share only SELECTED group of tabs</p>

<h3 id="total-tabs-in-my-onetab">Total tabs in my OneTab</h3>

<p>My OneTab has 77 tabs at the moment! Imagine what would happen if I wanted to keep all of them open!</p>

<p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/tkwVjiL2WnM6sb9P2ZThes/QwkiSULg67ZoKAjEwXmHY" alt="" /></p>

<p>I still open 8-10 tabs while working, but now they don‚Äôt linger around. If I find them important for the next few days, I simply send them to OneTab.</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>

<p>If you try this too, don‚Äôt forget to share your feedback about how it went. If you already have any other tool, <strong>Hit Reply and tell me about it.</strong></p>

<p>Since 2020, there has been a crushing pressure on organizations across the world to look after their employees‚Äô mental health. To coo them, to babysit them. To parent them.</p>

<p>Now we know for a fact that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/mental-health/mental-health-labels-may-harm-good-why/">over-exposure to mental health related bombardment is actually doing more harm than good</a>.</p>

<p>In this candid article, David confesses how cringe he feels when he looks back at their mental health policy. I mean how fair is it to not show up at work because one is feeling ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù? Life is full of ups and downs. The sooner we stop ourselves as precious, the sooner we will feel better.</p>
