    <p>My last long-running weekly newsletter was named The Friday Newsletter (TFN).
On February 7th, 2025 I sunset it to focus on growing <a href="https://sisyphusconsulting.org">my firm</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out the full newsletter archive at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>And what about writing?</p>

<p>I shifted to publishing Sisyphus Notes. Unlike The Friday Newsletter, these notes do not follow any weekly or monthly goals.</p>
